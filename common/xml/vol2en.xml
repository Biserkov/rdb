		<h1>Paddyfield Warbler</h1>
		<p><b><i>Acrocephalus agricola</i></b> (Jerdon, 1845)</p>
		<p>Order Passeriformes</p>
		<p>Family Sylviidae</p>
		<p><b>Conservation status:</b> <i>in Bulgaria:</i> <b>Endangered EN</b>=C [2(a(i))], BDA-III.</p>
		<p><b>General distribution.</b> A Palearctic species, whose area extends from Southeastern Europe in the east to the coast of the Sea of Okhotsk and Manchuria; in the north it reaches Southwestern Siberia, and in the south – Turkey, the foot of the Great Caucasus Mountains, Iran, Tadzhikistan, Afganistan, Kazakhstan, Mongolia and China.</p>
		<p><b>Distribution and abundance in Bulgaria.</b> A breeding summer visitor with breeding places only along the Black Sea coast. Since its finding in the country in 1968 near Shabla Lake [1], there have been comparatively few observations [2]. At present the largest numbers during the multiplication season have been registered in Durankulak Lake: 40-100 pairs [3, 4, 5, 6], Shabla Lake – about 10 pairs [7, 8] and Shablenska Tuzla lake [2]. There are data about an expansion of its the area along the Southern Black Sea coast: Atanasovsko Ezero lake [4, 9], Alepu Marsh [4] and Dyavolsko Marsh [4]. The numbers during the breeding period in the country varies widely: 60-200 pairs [4, 5, 6].</p>
		<p><b>Habitats.</b> Reedbeds in shore salty, brackish or freshwater lakes and lagoons [10].</p>
		<p><b>Biology.</b> In Bulgaria it is almost unstudied. It probably breeds substituting or even second clutches, as young ones have been registered in nests both in the middle of June (Durankulak Lake) and in the middle of July (Shablenska Tuzla lake) [2, 3]. Nest building has been observed only with females birds of a pair in Durankulak Lake on 16 May [6]. In the population from the same lake, a large genetic variety has been registered [11]. The low percentage of ringed birds of that population found in the last 3 years also points to the large inflow of immigrants determining the numbers of birds breeding in Bulgaria [5].</p>
		<p><b>Similar species.</b> None.</p>
		<p><b>Negative factors.</b> Unknown, most probably for inter-species reasons (a greatly restricted distribution).</p>
		<p><b>Conservation measures taken.</b> Protected according to the Biological Diversity Act. Almost all the breeding places are included in Protected Territories and sites of the Ramsar Convention. A study of the genetic structure and the blood parasites of the birds of the population in Durankulak Lake is being carried out.</p>
		<p><b>Conservation measures needed.</b> Study of the numbers and the area of the populations, the biology and the ecology of the species; study of the genetic variety of the Bulgarian population, the processes of migration and exchange of genetic material in it and between the separate populations within the species' area.</p>

		<h1>Levant Sparrowhawk</h1>
		<p><b><i>Accipiter brevipes</i> Severtzov, 1850</b></p>
		<p>Order Falconiformes</p>
		<p>Family Accipitridae</p>
		<p><b>Conservation status:</b> <i>in Bulgaria:</i>
			<b>Vulnerable VU</b>=D[1], BDA-II; <i>International:</i> CITES-II, BeC-II, BoC-II, ESC-Spec 2, BD-I.</p>
		<p><b>General distribution.</b> An Indo-African species with a major area the Balkan peninsula, Moldova and the Ukraine, in the west to Hungary and in the east to Turkey, Iran and Kazakhstan.</p>
		<p><b>Distribution and abundance in Bulgaria.</b> A breeding summer visitor and passage migrant. In the past, the data of the distribution of the species were scarce – with predominating observations from Southern Bulgaria and the Black Sea coast [1, 2, 3]. At present, it breeds from the sea level to altitudes of about 700 m [2, 4, 5]. It prefers river valleys, less frequently breeding in fields and low mountains. It is concentrated along the valleys of the larger rivers: in the lower reaches of the rivers Maritsa, Tundzha, Struma and Danube. At places, the separate pairs breed at a distance of 1.5-6 km one from the other [6, 7]. In the rest of the country, the area is greatly scattered [4]. The numbers are estimated at 200-400 pairs.</p>
		<p><b>Habitats.</b> Various deciduous forests, often in the vicinity of rivers or streams. It also hunts in open terrains and in agricultural areas.</p>
		<p><b>Biology.</b> It breeds on trees. The nest is thin, built out of branches. The full clutch consists of 2-5 eggs. Incubation continues for 30-35 days [2]. A nest with one egg was registered on 15 May. Young birds prior to flying away from the nest and young birds having already left the nest were observed at the end of July [6, 7]. It feeds on small mammals, birds, reptiles and insects [8]. A case of mellanism has been registered in Bulgaria [9].</p>
		<p><b>Similar species.</b> The Sparrowhawk (<i>Accipiter nisus</i>).</p>
		<p><b>Negative factors.</b> Loss and degradation of habitats as a result of large-scale forestation, clearcutting, building dams, fires. Lethality caused by clashes with electrical posts and buildings, transport vehicles and high-voltage lines; human poaching; disturbance.</p>
		<p><b>Conservation measures taken.</b> Protected according to the Biological Diversity Act. Included in the Red Data Book of Bulgaria (1985). It figures in popular editions for the preservation of birds of prey. Some of the breeding pairs fall within Protected Territories – national and natural parks, protected localities, reserves, etc.</p>
		<p><b>Conservation measures needed.</b> Focused studies on the numbers, the biology, the ecology and the threats for the species. Preparation and adoption of Management Plans for the protected territories in which it is found. Declaration of new Protected Territories: the Eastern Rhodopes Natural Park and the protected localities Adata and Zhdreloto na Tundzha. Increase of the nature conservation culture of the population. Inclusion of a text about birds of prey in textbooks for primary education.</p>

		<h1>Goshawk</h1>
		<p><b><i>Accipiter gentilis</i></b> Linnaeus, 1758</p>
		<p><i>Astur palumbarius </i>L.: Klain, 1909: 84.</p>
		<p>Order Falconiformes</p>
		<p>Family Accipitridae</p>
		<p><b>Conservation status:</b> <i>in Bulgaria</i>: <b>Endangered EN </b>[C2ai], BDA-III;<i> International: </i>CITES-II, BeC II, BoC-II.</p>
		<p><b>General distribution.</b> A Holarctic species inhabiting the forest regions of Europe, Japan, Korea, China, Mongolia, Vietnam, USA, Canada, Mexico [13].</p>
		<p><b>Distribution and abundance in Bulgaria.</b> A breeding summer visitor, passage migrant and winter visitor. Until 1950 it was a common multiplying species in the valleys and the mountains [6]. The numbers were estimated at between 100 and 500 breeding pairs [4]; according to other sources, it was a "rather rare species" during the multiplication season, with no more than 100 pairs [7, 8]. Since 1985, it has been "rather rare", numbering not more than 100 pairs [9], but according to other authors between 1 000 and 1 500 pairs, with a tendency for an increase [11], between 100 – 1 000 pairs [3], 1 700 – 2 100 pairs [5], between 500 – 1 500 pairs [10]. At present the numbers are about 1 200 – 1 500 pairs. In many regions a decrease of the number of the breeding pairs is observed.</p>
		<p><b>Habitats.</b> High-stem forests in the mountains and the valleys, riverside forests; old parks in the city/town and the suburban zone [12]. In many regions of Bulgaria it breeds in coniferous cultures, which are now one of the typical multiplying habitats for the species. The nests are often in the vicinity to villages or towns.</p>
		<p><b>Biology.</b> The multiplication period is in March and the beginning of April. It builds its own large nests, also using old nests of other birds of prey or crow birds. Usually every pair has 2-3 nests in its breeding territory that the birds use in different years. In April it lays 2-5 eggs, most often 3-4, incubating them for 35-38 days. The young ones leave the nest at the age of about 40 days after hatching. It feeds on small and moderately large birds (wild and domestic ones) and mammals [1].</p>
		<p><b>Similar species.</b> The Sparrowhawk (<i>Accipiter nisus</i>).</p>
		<p><b>Negative factors.</b> Illegal shooting; felling and forest fires; disturbance by herb and mushroom gatheres, etc.; taking the eggs and the young birds by poachers; persecution; clashes into vehicles, windows of buildings, etc.</p>
		<p><b>Conservation measures taken.</b> Protected according to the Biological Diversity Act. Included in the Red Data Book of Bulgaria (1985). Many of the breeding habitats are in National Parks (the mountains Central Balkans, Rila and Pirin), Natural Parks (Strandzha, the Vratsa area in the Balkan mountains); many reserves and Protected Localities.</p>
		<p><b>Conservation measures needed.</b> Observations of the ban on shooting the species and sanctioning people taking eggs and young birds from the nests; working out compensation programmes for damages inflicted on domestic birds. Control on wood production and collecting activities in the forests during the breeding period. Change of the legislation: express texts banning the breeding of predatory birds by private individuals and commercial organizations (falcon breeding, trade).</p>

		<h1>Russian Sturgeon</h1>
		<p><b><i>Acipenser gueldenstaedtii</i> Brandt &amp; Ratzeburg, 1833</b></p>
		<p>Order Acipenseriformes</p>
		<p>Family Acipenseridae</p>
		<p><b>Conservation status:</b> <i>in Bulgaria</i>: <b>Critically endangered CR </b>[A1ad], BDA-II, IV;<i> International:</i> IUCN [EN A2d], CITES-II, HD-V.</p>
		<p><b>General distribution.</b> The Black Sea, the Sea of Azov and the Caspian Sea as well as the rivers that empty into them. The Black Sea rivers where the species migrate for spawning are: Danube, Dniester, Southern Bug and Dnieper. In the Danube River, it reaches Bratislava, entering also its main tributaries: Drava, Sava, Tisa and Morava Rivers. The Sea of Azov rivers where it spawns are Don and Kuban. The main river for spawning of the Russian sturgeon in the Caspian Sea is the Volga River.</p>
		<p><b>Distribution and abundance in Bulgaria.</b> In the past, the species was found frequently in the Danube River and along the Bulgarian Black Sea coast [1, 2, 3, 4]. In recent years, its abundance has declined considerably [5]. In the period 2002-2005 alone, its annual catch in the Danube and the Black Sea has decreased 4-fold [6].</p>
		<p><b>Habitats.</b> In different periods of the year, it is found in different habitats. During the reproduction period, it inhabits permanent large rivers, and during the rest of the period – open sea, coastal areas and estuaries.</p>
		<p><b>Biology.</b> The males reach sexual maturity at the age of 11–13 years and females at 12–16 years [2]. Spawning occurs in April–May at water temperature of 12–15°C [7]. The fecundity varies from 50 000 to 1 165 000 eggs [8]. Eggs are laid in deeper water over sandy and gravel substrate [9]. The juvenile Russian sturgeons feed on insects and their larvae, worms and crustaceans, while the adults feed on mollusks, crustaceans and fish [7, 9].</p>
		<p><b>Similar species</b>: In the Bulgarian section of the Danube River and the Black Sea, another 5 species of sturgeons have occurred: the beluga (<i>Huso huso</i>), the ship sturgeon (<i>Acipenser nudiventris</i>), the sterlet (<i>A. ruthenus</i>), the starry sturgeon (<i>A. stellatus</i>) and the common sturgeon (<i>A. sturio</i>). The Russian sturgeon differs in having shorter, blunt snout and comparatively lower number of lateral scutes (21–50).</p>
		<p><b>Negative factors.</b> Loss (degradation) of spawning grounds, as a result of river regulation by dams and weirs; water pollution; poaching and overfishing.</p>
		<p><b>Conservation measures taken.</b> The species was included in the Red Book of the Black Sea (1999) and in Annexes II and IV of the Biological Diversity Act (2002). An Action Plan for the Conservation of Sturgeons in Bulgaria has been adopted (Ministry of Environment and Water, 2004). A temporary ban on catch of sturgeons in the Black Sea was initiated (Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, 2006).</p>
		<p><b>Conservation measures needed.</b> Imposition of a total ban on sturgeon fishery in the Danube River and the Black Sea. Reintroduction of the species into the Danube River.</p>

		<p><b>General distribution.</b> The rivers flowing into the Caspian Sea, the Black Sea, the Sea of Azov, the Baltic Sea, the White Sea, the Barents Sea and the Kara Sea. In the Danube River and some of its bigger tributaries – as far upstream as Austria, and in the past, upstream to Germany.</p>
		<p><b>Distribution and abundance in Bulgaria.</b> The species is found only in the Danube River [1, 2, 3, 4]. In the past, it was also recorded in the lower reaches of some of its tributaries: the Iskar River, upstream to the region of Lukovit [5], and the Yantra River upstream to the village of Dolna Studena [6]. In the period 1960-1974, the sterlet comprised about 3.7% of the total catch of all fish species, and 58.7% of the catch of sturgeons in the Danube River [3]. In 1995-2002, its share in the catch of sturgeons considerably decreased: only 3.7% [7].</p>
		<p><b>Habitats.</b> Permanent large rivers with swift current and gravel bottom. The species is found rarely in estuaries.</p>
		<p><b>Biology.</b> A bottom, mainly fresh water species. It is found very rarely in brackish water, always near the mouths of rivers [8]. In winter, it aggregates in bottom holes, and in spring (April-June) it migrates upstream for spawning. The males reach sexual maturity at the age of 3-6 years, 1-2 years earlier than the females. Eggs are laid in swift current over gravel bottom at water temperature of 12-17&deg;C. The fecundity of females ranges between 4 900 and 140 600 eggs. It feeds on crustaceans, insect larvae, worms, small mollusks and eggs of other fish. The life span is 22-24 years, and females live longer than males [4].</p>

		<p><b>Conservation status:</b> <i>in Bulgaria</i>: <b>Critically endangered CR </b>[A1ad], BDA-II, IV; <i>International</i>: IUCN [EN A2d], BeC-III, CITES-II, HD-V.</p>
		<p><b>General distribution.</b> The Caspian Sea, the Sea of Azov, the Black Sea and the Aegean Sea, as well as the rivers that empty into them. The largest population is found in the Caspian Sea, where the species enters the rivers Volga, Ural, Terek, Kura, etc., for spawning. In the Sea of Azov, it migrates into the rivers Don and Kuban. In the Black Sea, it enters the Danube River and its tributaries Sava, Drava, Prut, etc. In the Aegean Sea, single individuals enter the rivers Struma and Maritsa.</p>
		<p><b>Distribution and abundance in Bulgaria.</b> In the past, it was a common species in the Bulgarian waters of the Black Sea and the Danube River [1, 2, 3]. It was also recorded, though rarely, in the Maritsa River [1, 2]. Over recent years, its abundance has declined considerably [4]. In the 2002-2005 period alone, its annual catch in the Danube River and the Black Sea decreased around 3-fold [5].</p>
		<p><b>Habitats.</b> During the reproduction period, it is found in permanent large rivers, and during the rest of the period – in open sea, coastal areas and estuaries.</p>
		<p><b>Biology.</b> The males reach sexual maturity at the age of 5–9 years and females at 10–13 years [6]. Spawning lasts from April through September, in deep water with strong current and sandy and gravel bottom [3, 7]. The fecundity varies between 700 000 and 2 120 000 eggs. Juveniles feed on insect larvae, and adults – on mollusks, crustaceans and fish [1, 3].</p>
		<p><b>Similar species</b>: In the Bulgarian section of the Danube River and the Black Sea, another 5 species of sturgeons have been reported: the beluga (<i>Huso huso</i>), the Russian sturgeon (<i>Acipenser gueldenstaedtii</i>), the ship sturgeon (<i>A. nudiventris</i>), the sterlet (<i>A. ruthenus</i>) and the common sturgeon (<i>A. sturio</i>). The starry sturgeon differs by its long sword-like snout and lower number of lateral scutes (26–43).</p>
		<p><b>Negative factors.</b> Loss (degradation) of spawning grounds, as a result of river regulation by dams and weirs; water pollution; poaching and overfishing.</p>
		<p><b>Conservation measures taken.</b> The species was included in the Red Book of the Black Sea (1999) and in Annexes II and IV of the Biological Diversity Act (2002). An Action Plan for the Conservation of Sturgeons in Bulgaria has been adopted (Ministry of Environment and Water, 2004). A temporary ban on catch of sturgeons in the Black Sea was initiated (Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, 2006).</p>
		<p><b>Conservation measures needed.</b> Imposition of a total ban on sturgeon fishery. Reintroduction of the species into the Danube River.</p>

		<p><b>Distribution and abundance in Bulgaria.</b> In the past, only single specimens were recorded in the Black Sea [1], mainly in the coastal area near Varna and Burgas [2]. In the Danube, the common sturgeon entered the area of the delta [3, 4], but it is doubtful whether it reached the Bulgarian section of the river [5]. In the past, in the Aegean Sea, the species entered the rivers Struma [2] and Maritsa, where it reached the city of Plovdiv [6]. In the past 50 years, it has not been recorded in Bulgaria [7].</p>
		<p><b>Habitats.</b> In different periods of the year, it is found in different habitats. During the reproduction period, it inhabits permanent large rivers, and during the rest of the period - open sea, coastal areas and estuaries.</p>
		<p><b>Biology.</b> The male individuals reach sexual maturity at the age of 7-9 years, and the females at the age of 8-14 years [4]. Spawning is from April to May. Eggs are deposited in swift current over sandy or gravel bottom [1]. Fecundity ranges between 200 000 and 5 700 000 eggs. The young individuals feed on larvae of aquatic insects, worms, crustaceans and mollusks, and the adults - on mollusks, worms and small fish [8].</p>
		<p><b>Similar species.</b> In the Bulgarian section of the Danube River and the Black Sea, another five species of sturgeons have been recorded: the beluga (<i>Huso huso</i>), the Russian sturgeon (<i>Acipenser gueldenstaedtii</i>), the ship sturgeon (<i>A. nudiventris</i>), the sterlet (<i>A. ruthenus</i>) and the starry sturgeon (<i>A. stellatus</i>). The common sturgeon is distinguished by the lower number of lateral scutes (between 24 and 36) and the presence of dense cross-lines of smaller rhombic plates between the dorsal and lateral rows of plates.</p>
		<p><b>Negative factors.</b> Loss (degradation) of habitats, as a result of hydrotechnical activities leading to river regulation by dams and weirs; water pollution; poaching and overfishing in the past.</p>

		<p><b>General distribution.</b> A Siberian-Canadian species. It breeds in the boreal parts of the northern hemisphere. In Europe, apart from the northern parts, it inhabits the Alps, the Carpatians, the Pyrenees, the Balkan peninsula, the Caucasus Mountains and Asia Minor. In the Balkans it is a glacial relict.</p>
		<p><b>Distribution and abundance in Bulgaria.</b> Resident. At the beginning of the 20th century it was widely distributed in the mountains, especially in the Rhodopes [4]. In 1985, it was already considered on the verge of extinction, known only from several habitats, mainly in Rila mountain [1] and the Balkan range [2, 3]. At present, it is widely distributed in most mountains, mainly in the Rila-Rhodope massif, the Central and the Western Balkan range [5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11]. The total numbers may be estimated at 1 025 – 1 400 pairs. The values of the numbers in the major habitats, according to data from the 1995-2005 period, are, as follows (mountains): Rila – 300-400 pairs, Pirin – 200-220 pairs, Vitosha – 25- 40 pairs, the Rhodopes – 400-600 pairs (?), the Central Balkan range – 50-70 pairs, the Western the Balkan range – 25-35 pairs, Plana – 10-15 pairs, Osogovo – 5-10 pairs, Slavyanka – 10-12 pairs.</p>
		<p><b>Habitats.</b> Coniferous and mixed forests. It breeds mainly in old spruce and pine forests between altitudes of 1 100 and 1 950 m. It also breeds, less often, in pure beech forests [8, unpublished data].</p>
		<p><b>Biology.</b> It courts in the period from March to May and in the autumn: September-October. It breeds most frequently in hollows in trees of the black woodpecker. Between April and the beginning of May, the female lays 4-7 white eggs; it incubates for 25-29 days, the young ones leave the nest at the age of 30-32 days [12]. It feeds on small mammals, less often birds and insects [13].</p>

		<p><b>General distribution.</b> a Mongol-Tibetan species. In Europe it breeds in isolated habitats: a total number of about 1800 pairs.</p>
		<p><b>Distribution and abundance in Bulgaria.</b> Resident and wandering species. Breeding was registered in the 19th century: in 1865 and 1866 there were 3 nests, and in 1877 one [2] [3]. For 1985, the breeding of 1-2 pairs is supposed [4]. The last known habitat of a multiplying pair is from 1993 [5], when a nest was found, and in 1994 the pair did not inhabit it. For 2006, episodic breeding of not more than 2 pairs is supposed. Birds observed in Bulgaria breed in Greece and visit the country when looking for food. As a result of nature conservation activities and regular feeding, in the region of the river Bjala Reka and in the Valchi Dol reserve, permanent groups of 6-8 individuals are periodically observed [6, 7]. The largest group of feeding Black Vultures (42 individuals) was registered at a site near the village of Pelevun in 2000 [6]:</p>
		<p><b>Habitats.</b> Valleys of large rivers or reservoirs with shrub or grass associations, most characteristic in the Eastern Rhodopes.</p>
		<p><b>Biology.</b> It breeds in thin colonies or in singular individuals, building the nests mostly in the crown of the trees, rarely on rocks. Sexual maturity is reached at 6-7 years of age. The female lays one egg that it incubates for 50-55 days. The young one flies from the nest at the age of 3-3,5 months. It feeds on carrion (mainly middle-sized and large corpses of domestic and wild animals) [8].</p>
		<p><b>Similar species.</b> Similar to the other species of vultures.</p>
		<p><b>Negative factors.</b> Loss of habitats, reduction of the nutrition base, disturbance, poisoning, illegal hunting.</p>
		<p><b>Conservation measures.</b> A protected species since 1962, included in the Balkan Vulture Action Plan (BVAP) [9] envisaging both in-situ activities and measures for breeding in artificial conditions and re-introduction. Regular artificial feeding and monitoring, including telemetric follow-up, are organized. Information captions are prepared, social campaigns are waged in defense of vultures and against the use of poisons and illegal shooting. Possibilities for its re-introduction in appropriate habitats are discussed.</p>

At present there are different estimates of the numbers in the country: 600 – 1 000 breeding pairs [5]; 2 500 breeding pairs [6] and 3000 breeding pairs [7]. The numbers are declining in the whole area.</p>
		<p><b>Habitats.</b> Shrub associations, rocky terrains in the mountains, usually between altitudes of 900 and 2 500 m.</p>
		<p><b>Biology.</b> Monogamous. Ground breeding. From the end of April to June, the female lays 8-14 eggs that it incubates for 24-26 days. On the 7-10th day, the young ones can already fly. In the non-breeding season it lives in flocks, and during the multiplication period in pairs. It mainly feeds on parts of plants: seeds, fruits and green stems, leaves and buds. It makes vertical migrations and in the winter descends to lower areas.</p>
		<p><b>Similar species.</b> The Chukar (<i>Alectoris chukar</i>)<i>,</i> the Red-legged Partridge(<i>Alectoris rufa</i>).</p>
		<p><b>Negative factors.</b> Excessive shooting, disturbance by tourism, building in the mountains; hybridization with the chukar, destruction and change of the habitats, probably also infectious diseases spread by the introduced chukars.</p>
		<p><b>Conservation measures taken.</b> About one fourth of the habitats are included in Protected Territories (the national parks Central Balkans, Rila, Pirin).</p>
		<p><b>Conservation measures needed.</b> Artificial breeding; introduction in areas with former habitats of the species; a ban on hunting; a discontinuation of settling the chukar in the areas where the <i>A. graeca </i>is an autochtonous inhabitant; nature conservation education among local people; preservation of the open unprotected nests until the young ones fly away.</p>

		<p><b>General distribution.</b> It inhabits the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov. In the Black Sea, it occurs in the south of Kerch Strait, along the Caucasus Mountains coast, as well as along the coasts of Bulgaria and Romania. In the Sea of Azov, it is found in the summer, mainly in its western parts, entering the Gulf of Taganrog and the delta of the Don River.</p>
		<p><b>Distribution and abundance in Bulgaria.</b> Along the Bulgarian coast of the Black Sea, it is found rarely, mainly in April and May but not every year [1, 2, 3, 4]. It has been reported in the region of Burgas [1, 5], Cape Kaliakra and Varna Bay [6, 7].</p>
		<p><b>Habitats.</b> It inhabits the open sea, mainly the bathypelagic zone. Occasionally, it enters brackish waters, but it avoids purely fresh water sections.</p>
		<p><b>Biology.</b> A non-anadromous species. It prefers cold marine water, with temperature in the range from 10 to 15 &deg;C. It winters in the western part of the Black Sea, whereby, in contrast to the Pontic shad, it does not migrate to its southernmost regions. Sexual maturity is attained in the second year at body length of 13–15 cm. Spawning occurs from April to the middle of June, most likely in the brackish waters in the western parts of the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov. The species feeds on small fish (sprat, anchovy, small needle fishes, etc.) and crustaceans [4].</p>
		<p><b>Similar species.</b> In the Bulgarian section of the Black Sea, it is found together with the Pontic shad (<i>Alosa pontica</i>), from which it can be differentiated by the smaller sizes and the lower number of gill rakers on the first gill arch – 29-39.</p>

		<p><b>Distribution and abundance in Bulgaria.</b> In the past, it was a common species along the Bulgarian Black Sea coast during March and April, and in the Danube River - during May [1, 2, 3, 4]. It has been recorded in the Danube River [5, 6], Varna Lake [7] and the lower reaches of the rivers Kamchiya, Ropotamo, Karaagach and Veleka [8, 9, 10, 11]. Recently, it was found near Kaliakra [12], Varna Bay [13] and the Ropotamo River [14]. Its occurrence in the rivers Veleka and Karaagach has not been confirmed [15, 16]. The abundance of the species has declined considerably [12, 13]. In the period from 2002 to 2005, its annual catch in the Black Sea and the Danube decreased 2.5-fold [17].</p>
		<p><b>Habitats.</b> The main habitats of the species are in the open sea and in the permanent large rivers.</p>
		<p><b>Biology.</b> An anadromous fish. It winters in the sea, and enters the bigger rivers for spawning. The eggs are released from April to July at water temperature of 17-22°C [18]. The fecundity of females ranges from 20 800 to 289 400 eggs [19]. The fertilized eggs are bathypelagic and develop while floating downstream in the rivers.

		<p><b>General distribution.</b> The Netherlands, Estonia, Lithuania, Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Northeastern Italy, Hungary, Romania, Northern Bulgaria, the Ukraine and Northern Asia to the Far East (the rivers Ural, Ob and Amur).</p>
		<p><b>Distribution and abundance in Bulgaria.</b> Only known from the Danube. The species has been reported near Lom and Ruse between 1954 and 1964, most often with few specimens [1, 2]. It has not been found since 1973 in the Bulgarian section of the Danube [3, 4].</p>
		<p><b>Habitats.</b> A psammophilous species inhabiting rivers with sandy bottoms or sand mixed with small quantities of detritus, as well as sand-clay or sand-gravel substrate covered with a thin layer of dead organic matter (fallen leaves) [5]. The nymph lives in the middle and the lower courses of lowland rivers (up to altitudes of 200 m) [6]. It prefers strong currents [7], beta-mesosaprobic water and a depth of 1-2 m [8, 9] but it has also been found at larger depths, up to 9 m [7].</p>
		<p><b>Biology.</b> The nymph is of the swimming type, with a small head. It buries itself quickly into the sand with the help of its large and long claws of the forelegs. It feeds on dead organic matter (detritus) [5, 10]. The species has one generation yearly. After egg hatching, there follows a fast development of the nymphs until the end of the autumn and their slow maturing in the winter. The adult emerges in the spring of the following year (in May and the beginning of June). Before the metamorphosis the nymph goes out of the sand and swims onto the surface. The subimago lives for 24 hours and the adult up to 2-3 days [5]. After the mating, the females lay eggs on the water surface.</p>
		<p><b>Negative factors.</b> The main threats for the species are degradation of habitats, the water pollution of the Danube and of its large tributaries in Bulgarian section.</p>
		<p><b>Conservation measures taken.</b> None.</p>

		<p><b>Conservation status:</b> <i>in Bulgaria</i>: <b>Critically endangered CR </b>[B2a; C2a].</p>
		<p><b>General distribution.</b> Norway, Sweden, Finland, Northern and Central Russia, Ireland, Scotland, England, France, Germany, Switzerland, Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Romania and Bulgaria. A glacial relict with a boreomontane distribution. In Central and Southern Europe, it inhabits only mountains.</p>
		<p><b>Distribution and abundance in Bulgaria.</b> Known from Rila and Pirin mountains. It was recorded in July and August in Borovets (1939), Breznishki Lakes (1968) and Argirovo Lake (1981) with few specimens [1]. From a stream near Ropotamo River (Strandzha Mts.), nymphs are reported (1940) [2]. There are no current data of finding the species.</p>
		<p><b>Habitats.</b> Adults occur near clean and cold water bodies in the mountains with lower temperatures of the water during a long period of the year [1]. The nymphs inhabit small mountainous streams and lakes with stony bottoms without organic load. An indicator of xenosaprobic waters [3, 4, 5].</p>
		<p><b>Biology.</b> One generation yearly with overwintering in nymphal stage. Before metamorphosis, the last instar nymphs usually crawl out during the day onto the stones and vegetation near the water surface. The males fly over the water in the afternoon hours. The period of emergence of the adults is long, from May to August. The eggs hatch from September to February [3]. The nymphs feed by filtrating or collecting organic detritus from the sediments [4]. They stick to the stones and the underwater vegetation or swim fast.</p>
		<p><b>Negative factors.</b> Climatic changes leading to an increase of the water temperature. Increase of the risk of organic pollution of the water bodies. Destruction of the river beds by hydrotechnical building and degradation of habitats. Elimination of the shore vegetation, on which the adult emerges, reduces the possibility for successful reproduction.</p>
		<p><b>Conservation measures taken.</b> The localities in Pirin Mts. are included in the Pirin National Park.</p>

		<p><b>General distribution.</b> The northern part of the Atlantic Ocean, the fresh waters of Europe and Northern Africa, England, Iceland, the Baltic Sea. It is also found along the coasts of the Mediterranean Sea, the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov.</p>
		<p><b>Distribution and abundance in Bulgaria.</b> In the past, it was found in: the Danube River, adjacent marshes and some of its tributaries; Sozopol Bay, the Kamchiya River and most of the coastal lakes; the rivers Maritsa and Tundzha and the adjacent marshes [1, 2, 3, 4]. It was also recorded in some of the inland marshes – Batak and Straldzha, the latter being the largest habitat of the species in Bulgaria [2, 5]. After the 1950s, as a result of the extensive draining of the marshlands, the species disappeared from many of its habitats, and single specimens were caught only in the rivers of the Aegean Sea basin and some coastal lakes [5]. Later, it was recorded in the Maritsa River basin [6], in Varna Lake and Beloslav Lake [7] and the rivers Kamchiya, Ropotamo and Veleka [8]. At present, it is a rare species, with its occurrence confirmed in the rivers Mesta [9], Vacha [10], Arda [11], Veleka [12], in the Danube and in Burgas Lake (our data).</p>
		<p><b>Habitats.</b> Spawning takes place in the sea. It lives in fresh waters until it reaches sexual maturity. In Bulgaria, it has been found most frequently in the lower reaches of rivers, but it also occurs in standing water basins.</p>
		<p><b>Biology.</b> An anadromous species. Spawning takes place in the Sargasso Sea. Eggs are layed at a depth of 700-1000 m and water temperature of 16-17°C. The newly hatched larvae undergo metamorphosis, and after 3-4 years reach the European coasts. The females enter the rivers and migrate upstream. After attaining sexual maturity in about 8 years, they again head towards the sea. In the estuaries, they meet the males, and swim together actively, covering about 7-8 thousand km in the course of 3 years, until they reach the Sargasso Sea [13]. It feeds on mollusks, crustaceans and fish [5, 14, 15].</p>

		<p><b>Distribution and abundance in Bulgaria.</b> A breeding summer visitor, passage migrant and winter visitor. In the past it mainly incubated in the larger marshes along the Danube and the lakes along the Black Sea coast, the numbers of the population not exceeding 25 pairs [1, 2]. At present it continues breeding irregularly in the known habitats. The breeding population varies between 5 and 25 pairs [3] and, according to recent estimates, 20-30 pairs [4]. In the last 10 years, there was a tendency for a decrease of its numbers [5]. During migration larger concentrations are registered along the Danube [2]. For the 1977-1996 period, the average numbers of the wintering birds in the country were 793 (8-1532). Most of them winter along the Danube, where Srebarna Lake is of greatest significance (a maximum of 1 000 individuals in 1978). Since 1997, a decrease of the average numbers of the wintering birds has been observed [6].</p>
		<p><b>Habitats.</b> Lakes and marshes with vast reedbeds and a good nutrition base. On Persina Island, it also breeds in flooded willow forests, where it also spends the time for moulting.</p>
		<p><b>Biology.</b> The pairs occupy the breeding territory in February. It breeds singularly on a small island, amongst the reed or on a fallen old tree. Laying eggs takes place in March. The clutch contains 4-7 white eggs, and the first young ones appear in the middle of April; they start flying in about 50-60 days. The family is preserved in the autumn and the winter. The food contains different meadow plants. During the winter the birds feed in the fields with winter crops, together with the white-fronted goose [2].</p>

			<b>Vulnerable VU</b> A[2(a+c)] + B[2(b(i+ii+)+c(i)] + C[1 + 2(a(i))], BDA-IV; <i>International:</i> BeC-III, BoC-III, BD-II/1.</p>
		<p><b>General distribution.</b> A Palearctic species. Common in the boreal, moderate, Mediterranean, steppe and desert climatic regions, up to 65° N, and in the east up to Sahalin island and Kamchatka peninsula [1].</p>
		<p><b>Distribution and abundance in Bulgaria.</b> A breeding summer visitor and passage migrant. In the past it was widely distributed along the marshes/swamps and lakes in the country [2, 3, 4]. In the second half of the 20th century, it was preserved as breeding only along the Danube and some internal water basins [5] and is now considered a rare breeding species with numbers between 100 and 150 pairs [6]. Probably, the population declined after the drying up of many wetlands in the country but it still remains one of the most widely distributed breeding ducks in the country. It breeds along the Danube, the Black Sea coast, the Thracian lowland, the Sofia field and Western Bulgaria, albeit with a low density [7, 8]. There exist different estimates of the population, from 20 - 40 pairs [9] to 200-300 pairs [10]. In the <i>Atlas of Breeding Birds in Bulgaria</i> 100 – 350 pairs are mentioned [8].</p>
		<p><b>Habitats.</b> Marshes of different sizes, fish farms, microreservoirs, sometimes temporary water basins with overgrowth along the shores.</p>
		<p><b>Biology.</b> It starts breeding in April. The nest is among the herbaceous vegetation not far from the shore of the water basin, covered with down, stems and leaves of plants. The clutch contains 7-10 eggs [6]. They feed mainly on different parts of plants, water invertebrates and larvae of water insects.</p>
		<p><b>Similar species.</b> A monotypical species, without similar species.</p>
		<p><b>Negative factors.</b> Destruction and damaging of the habitats, disturbance during the breeding season. The species is an object of hunting and probably some of the breeding population and its growth are shot during the hunting season, which limits the possibilities for reproduction and increase.</p>
		<p><b>Conservation measures taken.</b> Protected according to the Biological Diversity Act. Included in the Red Data Book of Bulgaria (1985). The major breeding places along the Danube have been declared Protected Territories: Orsoya, Srebarna Lake, Belene Island and Kalimok. The breeding places along the Black Sea coast: the lakes Durankulak, Shabla, Yatata and Poda are also protected. Management Plans have been worked out for 4 of the breeding places.</p>
		<p><b>Conservation measures needed.</b> Updating of the National Plan for the Preservation and Restoration of Wetlands in Bulgaria. Development of Management Plans for the wetlands in which the species breeds. Working out and implemeting appropriate agro-ecological measures for fish farms, aimed at the preservation and the attraction of the species to nesting.</p>

		<p><b>General distribution.</b> A Palearctic species. It breeds in Europe, Asia, and Central Northern America. In Europe, the area is markedly split into separate habitats, isolated one from the other. In the north it reaches 60° N, and in the south up to 35° N.</p>
		<p><b>Distribution and abundance in Bulgaria.</b> A breeding summer visitor, passage migrant and wintering species, in the past it was common and numerous throughout the country [1, 2]. It started to decline in the middle of the 20th century [3]. Since the end of the 20th century to the present day, the breeding distribution has been preserved, located along the wetlands of the Danube and the Black Sea coast [4, 5]: the Orsoya Fish Farms Protected Locality, the Kalimok-Brashlen Natural Park, Persina, the Mechka Fish Farm, the Srebarna Natural Reserve and the complex of wetlands around the city of Burgas [6, 7]. In the other breeding places, there are only separate pairs pairs. In the 1980s, the numbers were estimated at 30-50 pairs pairs [4]. In the 1996 – 2002 period it varied withing 50 – 80 pairs [6]<i>. </i>During migration it is found throughout the country [5]. In the winter it is regularly observed, but in small numbers (10-100 individuals) [8]. For the period 1977-2001, about 70 birds at the average (a maximum of 129 /1991) [9], mainly in Southern Bulgaria and along the Black Sea coast [5].</p>
		<p><b>Habitats.</b> Various wetlands. Along the Danube, in marshes and lakes with rich submerged vegetation and large reedbeds, in the region of the Burgas lakes in water basins with a large open water surface and vegetation located along the periphery [6]. During migration and wintering in various wetlands, including slow flowing rivers and sea bays [5].</p>
		<p><b>Biology.</b> It breeds from the second half of April and the beginning of May. It incubates most often on the shore in high marsh vegetation, amidst the grass or under bushes. The nest is covered with grass and down, it lays 8-12 eggs. Basically a plant-eating species: seeds and different parts of water and hydrophyte plants. Cases have been described of cleptoparasitism with respect to other water birds [10].</p>
		<p><b>Similar species.</b> Monotypical, no similar species.</p>
		<p><b>Negative factors.</b> Destruction and damaging of the habitats, disturbance during the breeding season.</p>
		<p><b>Conservation measures taken.</b> A protected species as of 1962, included in the Red Data Book of Bulgaria (1985). The major habitats along the Danube are protected territories: Orsoya, Srebarna, Kalimok and Belene island; restoration of the water regime is envisioned for the last two wetlands. Along the Black Sea coast, Yatata and Poda are also protected. Management Plans have been developed for lakes Poda and Srebarna.</p>

		<p><b>Conservation status:</b>
			  <i>in Bulgaria:</i> <b>Extinct EX</b>, BDA-III; <i>International:</i> CITES-II, BeC-II, BoC-II.</p>
		<p><b>General distribution.</b> A Paleoxeric species that breeds in the Ukraine, Southern Russia, Kazakhstan, Mongolia, Northern China. It winters in Africa to the south of Sahara and in Industan.</p>
		<p><b>Distribution and abundance in Bulgaria.</b> At present a passage migrant, in the past it was found in the breeding season near the city of Burgas (1904) and the town of General Toshevo (1951). Extinct as a breeding species about the middle of the 20th century; the last registered breeding is from 1951 [1]. During migration it was registered near Burgas (1958, 1959, 1969, 1982) and the town of Pomorie (1982) [1, 2]. After 1980, 2 birds were observed on 25-27 April 2001 near Durankulak Lake [3]. Probably singular Demoiselle Cranes or small flocks (of 8-12 individuals) still fly along the Bulgarian Black Sea shore. It is possible for singular pairs to start breeding in Northeastern Bulgaria (Dobrudzha), as the Ukrainian and the Russian breeding populations are growing.</p>
		<p><b>Habitats.</b> Steppes, savannas, open large terrains without forests near river valleys but also mountainous steppes (plateaus), grassy (including bushes) and sandy, clayey terrains, stone semi-deserts; it mainly breeds in herbaceous associations of wild corn plants – Spear-grass, Fescue, Mugwort etc. [1]. It also nests secondarily in areas under crops (winter crops, etc.).</p>
		<p><b>Biology.</b> In Bulgaria the population was migrational. Ground-nesting. It nests along the banks of rivers or marshes where it goes to drink water every day. The young ones are nidifugous. Monogamous. It lays 2 (1-3) eggs that it incubates for 27-29 days. In the spring, up to 10-20 individuals gather for courtship dances. It follows the herds of large grazing cattle to catch the alarmed insects among the grasses.</p>
		<p><b>Similar species.</b> Grus grus (the Common Crane, the Eurasian Crane).</p>
		<p><b>Negative factors.</b> Destruction and change of habitats, disturbance during breeding and migration, illegal hunting, environmental pollution with pesticides, mechanization, building, etc.</p>
		<p><b>Conservation measures taken.</b> Some wetland areas used for rest during migration are protected natural territories. Possibilities are discussed for developing a long-term programme for attracting migrating birds and birds that stop during migration, for supplying Demoiselle Cranes from the Ukraine or from Russia and their release as captive bred birds in flat steppe regions with the presence of standing water basins; for building a network of guarded places for rest during migration and courting.</p>

		<p><b>General distribution.</b> A Holarctic species. It breeds in Europe in the north to 70o N, in the south up to the Mediterranean islands. Distributed in Northern Africa; SW Asia, the Arab peninsula, Central Asia (Pamir, Tian Shan, the Himalaya range), China, Korea, Japan; Northern America. The European population numbers about 8 400 pairs [1].</p>
		<p><b>Distribution and abundance in Bulgaria.</b> Resident. In the middle of the previous century it was extremely rare and about to become extinct [2]. Several decades later the population is estimated at 120 – 140 pairs [3]. In the last 20 years, the numbers stabilized and there is now a tendency for a slight increase. At present, 70 certain and 54 probable breeding habitats are mapped throughout the country [4]. If the other 55 possible breeding habitats from the same mapping are taken into account, the species should probably amount to 120 – 150 pairs. The largest number (46,7%) has been found in the Balkan range and the area in front of the Balkan range, followed by those in the Rhodopes (22,9%), the valley of the middle reaches of the Tundzha River (6,6%), in Srednogorie and Kraishte, the mountains Rila and Pirin (4,9% each), the Danube valley (4,1%), the Osogovo – Belasishka mountain group and the Black Sea coast (2,5% each).</p>
		<p><b>Habitats.</b> Two types: hardly accessible rock complexes (85%) and deciduous forests. The certain breeding habitats are at altitudes from 200 to 2400 m.</p>
		<p><b>Biology.</b> The multiplication period begins in the first half of March. The female lays 1-2 eggs in April. The young ones hatch at the end of May and fly away from the nest about 15 August. Ground turtles are the preferred food. Remains of hamsters, foxes, hares, birds, snakes and lizards can also be found in the nests [5].</p>
		<p><b>Similar species.</b> The Imperial Eagle (<i>Aquila heliaca).</i>
		</p>
		<p><b>Negative factors.</b> Disturbance during incubation and feeding the young. Illegal shooting for personal collections, poisoning by placing baits for wolves, jackals and foxes.</p>

		<p><b>Distribution and abundance in Bulgaria.</b> A passage migrant, winter visitor and probably breeding species. In the past there were singular nesting reports without proved breeding for Sindel railway station, for the town of Krichim, the villages of Yarlovo, Buhovo, Eleshnitsa and Churek (Sofia region), and the Rila mountain [1]. It flies over the Black Sea coast, over the Pirin mountain and Slavyanka, and winters in the Kamchiyski Longoz [1, 2]. After 1985, it was registered in the breeding period along the Black Sea coast, in Strandzha (possible nesting in 1989), the Thracian lowland, Dobrudzha, the Eastern Rhodopes and Sakar [3, 4, 5, 6], without proof of breeding. In the area of possible breeding, a dead young individual was found in 1989 [10]. It migrates regularly along the Black Sea coast (Kaliakra, Balchik, Albena, the river Kamchiya, the Sunny Beach resort, Atanasovsko Lake, the river Ropotamo), near the Kotlenska Planina mountain, the Byala Reka river in the Eastern Rhodopes, etc. [4, 7, 8, 9]. It winters around the lakes Shabla and Durankulak, the Ropotamo River, the Ovcharitsa Reservoir, etc. [4].</p>
		<p><b>Habitats.</b> Wetlands with concentrations of wetland birds and high trees around, flooded and other deciduous forests, shores of water basins, open southeastern slopes with ascending air currents along the migration flyway.</p>
		<p><b>Biology.</b> Data are missing. In other countries it nests in trees. It lays 2 eggs that it incubates for 42-44 days. It feeds on small and moderately large vertebrates, insects, carrion [2].</p>
		<p><b>Similar species.</b> The Lesser Spotted Eagle (<i>Aquila pomarina</i>).</p>
		<p><b>Negative factors.</b> Insufficiently known. Pressure from hunting in the major wintering places (the lakes Shabla and Durankulak), possible competition by the Lesser Spotted Eagle (<i>Aquila pomarina</i>).</p>
		<p><b>Conservation measures taken.</b> Protected according to the Biological Diversity Act. There exist international commitments for conservation (a plan for the conservation of the species, including Bulgaria). The numbers and the area occupied have been clarified [5]. Monitoring of the numbers during the autumn migration [2, 4, 8] and of the wintering places [4, 11, 12]. The areas of significance are declared Important Bird Areas [7] and proposed for the <i>Natura 2000</i> network [13]. Some of the key places are protected (the lakes Shablensko, Durankulak and Atanasovsko), Management Plans have been worked out.</p>
		<p><b>Conservation measures needed.</b> Preparation and implementation of a National Plan for the conservation of the species. More active persecution of illegal shooting and illegal capture during the hunting season. Prevention of building wind turbines along the migration flyway. Management plans for the protected areas of significance for the species. Study of the current state, continuation of monitoring. Artificial feeding in wintering places.</p>

		<p><b>General distribution.</b> An Indo-African species with a breeding area in Russia, Turkey, Asia, India and Nepal. It winters from Eastern to Southern Africa, Iran, Pakistan, India, Indochina.</p>
		<p><b>Distribution and abundance in Bulgaria.</b> A wandering species. As breeding it was registered only in 1941 near the village of Rogozina, Dobrich region [1]. There have been singular observations in the localities Otmanli [2], the canyon of the river Chernelka, Pleven region [3], near the Sunny Beach resort [4] and during the migration in the different years from 1 to 7 individuals along the Black Sea coast [5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]. Birds were registered after 2001 in the Sliven field, the Besaparski Vazvisheniya (hills) and near Studen Kladenets Reservoir, sometimes staying there for more than a month (I. Angelov, Daskalova, D. Dermendzhiev, M. Kurtev, H. Hristov, personal communication). There have been singular observations in the mountains Sakar Planina (L. Profirov, B. Scott, personal communication), Ovchite Halmove (D. Dermendzhiev, personal communication) and Vitosha (S. Stoychev, Y. Hristov, personal communication). These are cases of non-multiplying, wandering, most frequently sexually immature birds (in separate cases also adults), mainly during migration but also during the multiplication period. During migration it has also been observed along the Black Sea coast and in Dobrudzha (P. Iankov, I. Dimchev, Gerdzhikov, V. Katrandzhiev, personal communication).</p>
		<p><b>Habitats.</b> Steppe and semi-steppe areas [11].</p>
		<p><b>Biology.</b> It breeds on low trees, rocks or on the ground [11]. In Bulgaria it has been observed eating hamsters, that it catches alone or acquires from other species of birds of prey, as well as walk-hunting insects and lizards for hours [I. Angelov, D. Demerdzhiev, personal communication).</p>
		<p><b>Similar species.</b> The Lesser Spotted Eagle (<i>Aquila pomarina</i>), the Greater Spotted Eagle (<i>Aquila clanga</i>), the Imperial Eagle (<i>Aquila heliaca</i>).</p>
		<p><b>Negative factors.</b> In the past, the intensification of agriculture and ploughing at places with secondary steppe vegetation and direct persecution. Threats are: poisoning, risk high-voltage lines, wind turbines, loss of the habitats and the food base.</p>
		<p><b>Conservation measures taken.</b> Protected according to the Biological Diversity Act. Included in the Red Data Book of Bulgaria (1985). The Sliven field, the Besaparski Vazvisheniya (hills), Sakar Planina mountain and Studen Kladenets Reservoir are included in the <i>Natura 2000</i> national network; monitoring is carried out there every month.</p>

		<p><b>Distribution and abundance in Bulgaria.</b> A breeding summer visitor, passage migrant and winter visitor. In the past it bred around the Danube and the larger rivers within the country, and in marshes along the Black Sea coast [2]. In the second half of the 20th century, a total of 24 breeding colonies was registered, numbering about 500 breeding pairs [3]. Registered at present are 86 places with certain breeding, mainly along the Danubian and the Black Sea coast, the area in front of the Balkan range and the valleys of the larger rivers [7]. The estimates of the breeding numbers in the country are rather different 200 – 2 000 [4], 500-700 [5], 1 000 – 1 400 [6, 7].</p>

		<p><b>General distribution.</b> A Turkestan-Mediterranean species with a fragmented area in the moderate climatic region of the Palearctic, in the steppes, semi-desert and southern forest zone of Western Europe, Northern Africa and Mongolia. [1].</p>
		<p><b>Distribution and abundance in Bulgaria.</b> A breeding summer visitor, passage migrant and winter visitor. At the end of the 19th century it was widely distributed and numerous [2, 3]. It is now common along the Danube and the Black Sea coast [4, 5]. Since the middle of 20 century, a reduction in the numbers has been observed [6]. Until the middle of the 1990s, 20 breeding places were known with 100-150 pairs [7, 8]. During mapping in 1997, 35 habitats were registered, with 150 – 210 pairs [9]. In 2002, the disappearance of 13 breeding places (of a total of 35) was reported but another 8 were found, new, and a total of 185 pairs registered. The breeding population varies from 150 to 230 pairs [10, 11, 12]. In June-August, along the Danube, gatherings of up to 3 000 individuals have been recorded [9]. Rare during the winter: from 0 to 70 individuals [9]; more regular wintering was registered after 1996 [14, 15].</p>
		<p><b>Habitats.</b> Mainly shallower fish farms, marshes and microreservoirs with mosaically situated vegetation, large reedbeds with small water mirrors and canals, with sloping shores and slimy shallows and hydrophytic vegetation [10]. During migrations: various wetlands. During wintering: lakes, reservoirs and small sea bays along the Black Sea coast.</p>
		<p><b>Biology.</b> It starts breeding in the second half of May, incubating in marshy vegetation or on the shore, in close vicinity to the water. It lays 8-10 (5-14) eggs [8, 13]. It mainly feeds on vegetation, also on water invertebrates and larvae of insects.</p>
		<p><b>Similar species.</b> A monotypical species.</p>
		<p><b>Negative factors.</b> Drying up of the wetlands, abandonment and/or intensification of fish farms, disturbance by fishermen and tourists. The markedly changeable water level in the breeding places.</p>
		<p><b>Conservation measures taken.</b> Protected according to the Biological Diversity Act. Included in the Red Data Book of Bulgaria (1985). The major breeding places are in Protected Territories and Protected Zones. Management Plans have been developed for the lakes Poda, Srebarna, Shabla and Durankulak.</p>

		<h1>Western Barbastelle</h1>
		<p><b><i>Barbastella barbastellus </i> (Schreber, 1774)</b></p>
		<p>Order Chiroptera</p>
		<p>Family Vespertilionidae</p>
		<p><b>Conservation status:</b> <i>in Bulgaria:</i>
			<b>Vulnerable VU </b>[B1 b(i, ii, iv)], BDA-II, III; <i>International:</i> IUCN-VU, BeC-II, BoC-II, HD-II, IV.</p>
		<p><b>General distribution.</b> Europe, in the north to the southern parts of the Scandinavian peninsula and Estonia; in the south to Morocco, the Canary islands; in the east to the Caucasus Mountains (including Azerbaijan and Armenia).</p>
		<p><b>Distribution and abundance in Bulgaria.</b> The species was found for the first time in Bulgaria near the mouth of the river Kamchiya in 1935 [1]. Until the end of 2006 it was known from 23 localities (only 6 before 1985) [2]. Most often it has been found in the Central [3] and the Western Balkan range [4] and in the Western Rhodopes [2]. Most shelters have been registered at altitudes of over 500 m. In the lower areas, singular individuals have been registered (Kresna gorge; the village of Zhernov, Pleven region; Chernomorets, Burgas region). The highest locality is in the Vodnite dupki cave in the Severen Dzhendem reserve (1 420 m) [3, 5]. The peculiarities in the distribution and the abundance show that its range in the Balkan peninsula is of a relict nature [6]. The numbers at places are good but as a whole they are low [7].</p>
		<p><b>Habitats.</b> Most preferred are the wet forest habitats in the middle mountainous belt (at altitudes of 700 – 1 400 m). During the winter it has been found singularly or in groups of up to 30 individuals in the coldest, entrance parts of the caves at temperatures about 0-2 &deg;C [5, 7]. In the summer months it lives almost only in hollows of trees and less often in other shelters (for example, cracks in rocks).</p>
		<p><b>Biology.</b> It probably breeds in most of the habitats found in the mountains, but so far there have been no concrete data. The only sure evidence of breeding in Bulgaria is in the dense forest of the river Kamchiya [1]. It makes local migrations, rarely exceeding 50 km. Data about the food range in Bulgaria are absent. In Central Europe it feeds on small nocturnal butterflies and flies [8].</p>
		<p><b>Negative factors.</b> Felling old tress and trees with hollows restricts the possibilities for finding appropriate shelters, especially for the nursery colonies. The direct disturbance of the cave colonies in the winter months may be the reason for the death-rate increase during that period.</p>
		<p><b>Conservation measures taken.</b> The species is protected according to the Biological Diversity Act, EUROBATS and all international conventions (without CITES). A small part of the habitats found fall within reserves (for example, Severen Dzhendem), within national (the Central Balkan National Park) and natural parks (the Rila Monastery). Some habitats are included in the List of Significant Underground Habitats of Bats in Bulgaria [9].</p>

Later, the species was found in the rivers Nishava and Iskretska [8], Palakariya [9], Iskar near Samokov, and the rivers Archar, Tsibritsa and Cherni Vit [10]. It was introduced to the Dospat Reservoir [11]. It was also found in the Vacha River of the Aegean Sea drainage basin [10]. As early as the 1970s, its range started to decline and the species disappeared from the rivers Yantra and Kamchiya [12, 13]. Its occurrence in the Osam River is not confirmed. At present, it is found in the rivers Nishava, Vidbol, Archar, Tsibritsa, and the upper reaches of the rivers Lom, Ogosta and Vit [our data].</p>

		<p><b>General distribution.</b> Europe: from England to the Dnieper River basin; in the north, to the North and Baltic Seas, in the south, to the Pyrenees and the Alps.</p>
		<p><b>Distribution and abundance in Bulgaria.</b> In the past, the species was recorded in the Danube River and all of its tributaries [1, 2, 3, 4]. Later, it was found in the Danube [5, 6, 7], in the middle and lower reaches of its tributaries Voynishka, Vidbol, Archar, Skomlya, Lom, Tsibritsa, Ogosta, Iskar, Vit, Osam, Yantra and Rusenski Lom [8, 9, 10, 11, 12], as well as in the Alexander Stamboliyski Reservoir [9]. Recently, its finding in the following rivers has been reported: the Danube, Ogosta, Lom [our data], Zlatna Panega (the Iskar River basin) and Vit [13]. In the period from 2002 to 2005, its annual catch in the Danube River diminished 3-fold [14]. The population abundance in the rivers Zlatna Panega and Vit is low [13].</p>
		<p><b>Habitats.</b> It inhabits the middle and lower reaches of permanent large rivers.</p>
		<p><b>Biology.</b> The species prefers sections with clean, cold and fast-flowing waters with a sandy-gravel substrate. The males reach sexual maturity at the age of 3-4 years, and the females at the age of 4-5 years. Before spawning they gather in groups and migrate upstream. Eggs are released in May-July. The fecundity of females ranges from 3 000 to 155 400 eggs. It feeds on algae, crustaceans, insect larvae and mollusks. It attains a maximum body length of 120 cm and a weight of 12 kg. The life span is 15-20 years [15].</p>
		<p><b>Similar species.</b> Balkan barbel (<i>Barbus petenyi</i>), Maritsa barbel (<i>Barbus cyclolepis</i>) and Crimean barbel(<i>Barbus tauricus</i>).

		<p><b>Distribution and abundance in Bulgaria.</b> A local endemic from the region of the town of Peshtera. Known to occur in two caves situated near one to the other: Novata and Yubileyna [1, 2, 3]. Young individuals, very probably of the same species, are also known from the Snezhanka cave, situated in the same region but at a higher altitude. Since 1990 the species has been registered in the two caves Novata and Yubileyna, where its populations are currently stable.

		<p><b>Distribution and abundance in Bulgaria.</b> The species was first recorded in the Rezovska River [1]. Later, it was recorded in other Black Sea rivers: Veleka [2], Eleshnitsa [3], Dvoynitsa [4], Sredetska and Fakiyska [5]. In the Kamchiya River, it was reported as early as the 1930s [6], but its occurrence was confirmed later [7]. In the past, it was widely found in the Kamchiya River, its tributaries and most of the adjacent marshes [8]. Its finding was also reported in the rivers Aheloy and Dyavloska [9]. At present, the species range is considerably decreased. It has been found in the Veleka River, where it is one of the most common species [10, 11], and probably in the Rezovska River. It has been recorded in the Kamchiya River basin and its tributary the Eleshnitsa River [our data], having disappeared in the adjacent marshes [12]. During the latest investigations (2005-2006), it was not recorded in the rivers Aheloy and Dyavolska.</p>
		<p><b>Habitats.</b> It is found in the middle reaches of permanent rivers with sandy and gravel bottom; it inhabits rarely estuaries.</p>
		<p><b>Biology.</b> Poorly known. A benthic reophilic species inhabiting sections with a moderate current. It reaches sexual maturity in the second year. The spawning period is probably from April to June. The fecundity of females is about 21 000 eggs. It feeds on bottom invertebrates and less on algae. It usually reaches a length of up to 30 cm. The largest specimen caught in Bulgaria was 38 cm [2, 13].</p>
		<p><b>Similar species.</b> It is differentiated from the Balkan barbel (<i>Barbus petenyi</i>) by the slender and weakly denticulated last unbranched dorsal fin ray, and from the Maritsa barbel (<i>Barbus cyclolepis</i>) - by the lower number of scales in the lateral line (up to 62).</p>
		<p><b>Negative factors.</b> The main threats to the species are water pollution, river regulation activities and poaching.</p>
		<p><b>Conservation measures taken.</b> None.</p>
		<p><b>Conservation measures needed.</b> Protection of the middle reaches of rivers flowing into the Black Sea against pollution; imposing restrictions on regulation activities there.</p>

		<p><b>Distribution and abundance in Bulgaria.</b> Resident. Until the middle of the 20th century it was frequently found in the large water basins (marshes in the Sofia field, in the marshes of the towns of Batak, Straldzha and Radomir and in the Upper Thracian lowland), along the Danubian and the Black Sea coast [1, 2], usually at altitudes under 600 m. [3]. With the drying up of the marshes after the 1950s, its population thinned. It breeds along the Black Sea coast (the lakes Durankulak, Shabla, Atanasovsko and the Poda Protected Site, Burgas region), in the Danube valley (the Kalimok locality, the fish farms near the village of Mechka and the village of Hadzhidimitrovo, at places in the Upper Thracian lowland and Western Bulgaria [2]. In the second half of 1990s, it increased its numbers in the lakes Shabla and Durankulak, in the Dragoman Marsh, in the fish farms of Hadzhi Dimitrovo, etc., but declined or disappeared from the former fish farms of Kalimok, from Srebarna Lake, etc. [2, 4]. It was reported for Persina Island, the lakes Durankulak, Varna and Atanasovsko, near the villages of Trivoditsi, Lebed and Gorno Ezerovo, [1]. Wintering birds were found in Aldomirovsko Blato marsh, the lakes Vaya, Mandrensko, Shabla and Durankulak, near the village of Bezden, the Rupite locality (Petrich region), the Poda Protected Site [4]. Observed in the Burgas lakes between 12 March and 21 October [5], during the spring migration in the fish farms in the Ormana locality (Yambol region) and during the autumn migration in Shabla Lake [4]. The numbers are declining: 25-30 [1], 10-50 [6], 40-50 [7], to 20-70 breeding pairs [8]. During the mapping of the breeding ornithofauna in the country, it was found in 38 breeding habitats: 18 certain, 7 probable and 13 possible [9].</p>

		<p><b>General distribution.</b> A paleoxeric species represented by two subspecies. The area of the subspecies <i>Buteo rufinus rufinus</i> embraces Asia (Syria, Iraq, Iran, Pakistan, Afganistan, Northwestern China and Mongolia) and Europe (the countries of the Balkan peninsula). Wandering or migrating birds have been registered in Italy, France, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Switzerland, Germany, Denmark and the Netherlands [1].</p>
		<p><b>Distribution and abundance in Bulgaria.</b> A resident, breeding passage migrant and wintering. After proving its breeding in the 1950s [2], new habitats were also registered [3]. The estimates of its abundance in Bulgaria increased from 50 [3], 200 – 300 [5], 250 – 400 [6], 550 – 580 [7] to 600 – 800 [8] and, according to us, the number of the breeding pairs is between 800 and 1 000 in about 500 habitats. Some of the population winters in the southern parts of the country.</p>
		<p><b>Habitats.</b> Rocks in gorges of rivers, separate rock complexes, stone quarries with open spaces around them (arable lands, pastures) that the birds use for hunting. It inhabits open hilly terrains in the feet of the mountains close to gorges of rivers.</p>
		<p><b>Biology.</b> It breeds on rock cornices, less frequently in deciduous and coniferous trees. The building of a new nest or the repairing of the old one takes place at the beginning of March, and in continuous warming also at lower altitudes – and at the end of February. The closest distance between two inhabitable nests is about 1200 m. It is tolerant to other birds of prey breeding in the region. Egg-laying starts from the first decade of March to the middle of April, and incubation – around the laying of the last egg of the clutch. In favourable years the number of the eggs and of the young ones bred is larger and reaches 4-5, or 6 in exceptional cases. A the age of about 50 days the young birds leave the nest (usually at the beginning of July) and stick around it for a week [9].</p>
		<p><b>Negative factors.</b> Degradation of the biotopes; forestation of large areas; accidental death by high-voltage lines; use of chemicals.</p>
		<p><b>Conservation measures taken.</b> Protected according to the Biological Diversity Act. Some breeding habitats are included within Protected Territories.</p>
		<p><b>Conservation measures needed.</b> Preparing Management Plans for the Protected Territories in which it is found. Taking into account the habitat requirements of birds of prey in forestry projects. Increase of the nature conservation culture of the local people.</p>

		<p>Order True bugs (Heteroptera)</p>
		<p>Family Burrowing bugs (Cydnidae)</p>
		<p><b>Conservation status:</b> <i>in Bulgaria</i>: <b>Extinct EX</b>.</p>
		<p><b>General distribution.</b> Spain, France, Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria, the Ukraine (the Crimea), Southern Russia (the Black Sea coast and the Caspian Sea coast of Northern Caucasus), Armenia, Azerbaijan (the Caspian coast), Kazakhstan (the Caspian coast), Turkmenistan (the Caspian coast), Afghanistan, China (Xinjiang).</p>
		<p><b>Distribution and abundance in Bulgaria.</b> Found once in 1888 near Nesebar [1]. It has not been recorded for the second time in spite of the intensive studies of the heteropterous fauna along the Black Sea coast and of the family Cydnidae in Bulgaria [2, 3].</p>
		<p><b>Habitats.</b> Shore and continental sand dunes.</p>
		<p><b>Biology.</b> A psammophilous species. It overwinters as adult or rarely as last instar nymph around the roots of the plants, under various vegetation remains, or in sand at a depth of up to 10 cm. The overwintered specimens become active after the middle of March. Mating takes place in April. Egg laying begins in April and continues until July. The nymphs hatch in June, those of the eggs laid later occur until November. The adult of the new generation emerges in July. The adults and the nymphs live in the upper layer of the sand at a depth of 2-10 cm and feed on the roots and the root parts of the stems of different cereals: <i>Leymus racemosus</i>, <i>Digitaria ischaemum</i>, <i>Carex arenaria</i>, <i>Elymus elongatus</i> [3, 4].</p>
		<p><b>Similar species.</b> The remaining species of the genus in Bulgaria, <i>Byrsinus balcanicus</i>, <i>B. flavicornis</i> and <i>B. pilosulus</i> [5], live in similar habitats with <i>B. fossor 
			</i>and have a similar biology [3, 4]. The latter species can easily be distinguished from them by the presence of thin and long hairs on the scutellum and on the whole surface of the chitinized part of the forewings.</p>
		<p><b>Negative factors.</b> Change of the habitats and the increase of the tourist flow near its single locality are the reasons for its extinction in Bulgaria. The sand dunes near Nesebar, where it occured, are practically destroyed, and the other dune complexes along the Black Sea coast are exposed to an enormous anthropogenic pressure.</p>

In the 80s an expansion started because of the ban on poisoning and the increase of wild hoofed animals; numbers – 600-700 individuals [2; Bulgarian Forestries Questionnaire, 1989]. In 1996-9 at least 1 000 individuals. At present the numbers are declining. At the end of the winter it inhabits an area of about 32 thousand km2 with 100-120 families (an average of 5 individuals) and numbers between 700 - 800 individuals (200-250 are breeding animals and 25% are nonterritorial wolves); with an average density of 5 000 ha/individuals over 1 000 m and 10 000 ha under this altitude. The family territory is 15 000 ha at the average, 25000 ha, respectively. During the breeding season it inhabits the mountains, partly Northeastern Bulgaria; in the autumn and until the middle of the winter it also goes down to the valleys [3]. [1; 3; 4; 5; 6; 7; 8; 9; 10; 11; 12; 13].</p>
		<p><b>Habitats.</b> It prefers mountainous regions with forests, shrubs, rocks, gorges and meadows that are difficult to access by human.</p>
		<p><b>Biology.</b> Monogamous, the couple is for the lifetime. Breeding animals in the packs are only the dominant couples. The mating season is in January-February. The cubs, 4-6 at the average, are born in April. In September the family pack (usually 5-8 wolves) gathers for the autumn-winter hunting. Trophically, the species in Europe is synanthropic. The basic prey consists of wild ungulates, sheep, carrion, dogs, goats, donkeys, etc. [2; 7; 14; 15; 16; Forestries Questionnaire, 1989].</p>

The latest records are from the Sofia field near Bezden Village (2005, 2006) and from the Eastern Rhodopes: Ivaylovgrad area (1963, 2002) and Plevun (1970).</p>
		<p><b>Habitats.</b> A mesohygrobitic and a stenohygrophilic species inhabiting steppe and lowland grass and shrub associations [6].</p>
		<p><b>Biology.</b> The nymphs hatch at the end of February and in March. The adults occur in Southern Bulgaria from the middle of May to August, and in Northern Bulgaria from June to September. Mating and egg-laying take place in June and July. Sometimes the eggs remain in a state of hyperpause for several years. The food consists of juicy and rotting vegetation parts, seeds, dead insects and living invertebrates. The males produce a very loud song, heard from a distance of 1 km.</p>
		<p><b>Similar species.</b> <i>Bradyporus dasypus</i>, from which it differs with the light hind part of the pronotum.</p>
		<p><b>Negative factors.</b> Enlargement of the agricultural fields, machine processing of the land and destruction of shrubs near the fields [2], as well as treatment with herbicides and pesticides.</p>

		<p>Family Fringillidae</p>
		<p><b>Conservation status:</b> <i>in Bulgaria:</i>
			<b>Vulnerable VU</b> C, BDA-III; <i>International:</i> BeC-II.</p>
		<p><b>General distribution.</b> A Palearctic species. It inhabits Eurasia from Eire in the east to Sakhalin island, in the south to the mountains in Central Europe, the Pyrenees, the Balkan peninsula and the Caucasus Mountains.</p>
		<p><b>Distribution and abundance in Bulgaria.</b> Resident. In the past there were data of possible breeding in some low parts of the country – around Burgas and Sofia [1, 2], but there is proved breeding only in the mountains [3, 4, 5]. More habitats were known in the Rhodopes, Vitosha mountain and the Balkan range [6, 7]. At present, it has an "island" distribution with a high degree of isolation between the separate subpopulations [8]. It is found in the coniferous belt of the mountains Balkan range, Vitosha, Rila, Pirin, the Rhodopes and Slavyanka [9, 10, 11, 12, 13]. The breeding density is low but it may vary considerably, depending on the production of seeds [14, 15]. The breeding population is estimated at 2 000 – 4 000 pairs, and the wintering one at 10 000 – 50 000 individuals [8, 16].</p>
		<p><b>Habitats.</b> Different types of coniferous forests: spruce, white fir and black fir, Scotch pine and black pine, less often dwarf mountain pine and mixed formations with a considerable altitude [8, 17, 18]. Outside the multiplication period it is found throughout the country.</p>
		<p><b>Biology.</b> The beginning of incubation is influenced by the abundance of seeds, and in years rich in strobiles it begins in March, and in years poor in strobiles it begins in May [15]. The nest is cup-like, built out of grasses, bast fibre, cobweb and feathers, masked with moss and lichen. It is located on a branch of a coniferous tree. It lays 3-6 subelliptical, pale-bluish eggs, coloured with dark little spots. It has up to two clutches yearly. Incubation lasts for 12-13 days. The young ones leave the nest at the age of 13-17 days [19]. It mainly feeds on the seeds of coniferous trees, alder and birch, and during the multiplication period also on invertebrate animals [19].</p>
		<p><b>Negative factors.</b> Destruction of the habitats by deforestation and building, catching individuals.</p>
		<p><b>Conservation measures taken.</b> Protected according to the Biological Diversity Act. About 50% of the breeding population inhabits the territory of National Parks, some Natural Parks and Reserves.</p>
		<p><b>Conservation measures needed.</b> Study of the biology and the ecology of the species in the country; follow-up of the population trends; preservation of the habitats.</p>

		<p><b>Conservation status:</b> <i>in Bulgaria</i>: <b>Critically Endangered CR </b>[B1ab(i,ii,iii,iv,v)+2ab(i,ii,iii,iv)].</p>
		<p><b>General distribution.</b> Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Romania, Moldova, the Western Ukraine, Serbia and Bulgaria.</p>
		<p><b>Distribution and abundance in Bulgaria.</b> The only reliable records are from the Western Balkan Range, from where the species was reported in the first two decades of the 20th century. It has been found along the Stara Reka Valley above Varshets [1, 2]. It has been published from the Balkan Range without an exact locality, according to material from the end of the 19th century [3]. In the last 50 years it was not found in Bulgaria. The populations in Bulgaria and Serbia have lower densities because of their relict character.</p>
		<p><b>Habitats.</b> A hygrophilous, sylvicolous and stenotopic species. It inhabits banks of fast flowing mountain rivers and streams, bogs and adjacent forest habitats in mountains and foothills [4].</p>
		<p><b>Biology.</b> The adult dives during the day and the night and may stay under the water surface for about 20-30 minutes. There it hunts on water molluscs, worms, scuds (<i>Gammarus</i>), larvae of water insects (caddisflies, water beetles of the genus <i>Agabus</i>) and young amphibians. The rest of the time it hides under stones or branches, also in the water. The mating takes place there in May, at a depth of up to several decimeters. Egg-laying is in June. The larva and the pupa develop in rotting wood close to the water. The development of the larva lasts for about 35 days, without a diapause. The adult appears in August and does not leave the place of its emerging before the following spring (winter diapause).</p>
		<p><b>Similar species.</b> <i>Carabus</i>
			<i>cavernosus</i>. The sides of the pronotum of the Rugged ground beetle are more strongly concave in their basal halves and its elytra have a more convex relief and tubercles (and not numerous pits as in <i>Carabus</i>
			<i>cavernosus</i>).</p>
		<p><b>Negative factors.</b> Decrease of the flow of mountain rivers and streams as a result of their use for domestic needs (irrigation, water supply). In the whole range, it is strongly endangered because of the disappearance of the natural habitat. An indicator of pure riverside forest habitats in Central and Eastern Europe.</p>
		<p><b>Conservation measures taken.</b> None.</p>

		<p><b>General distribution.</b> A Holarctic species inhabiting Europe and Asia from France and Southern Spain to Lake Baikal and Northern America – in the 60<sup>o</sup> to 40&deg; N latitude band.</p>
		<p><b>Distribution and abundance in Bulgaria.</b> A breeding summer visitor and passage migrant [1]. In the past it bred along the marshes around the Danube and along the Black Sea coast [1, 2]. Now its distribution and numbers are unclear. Irregularly and in very small numbers, it breeds in the marsh near the village of Malak Preslavets and in the Srebarna Reserve [1,3]. Some fish farms in the country also have a potential for breeding [4]. The breeding population varies between 0 and 100 pairs [5]. According to more recent estimates, it is between 30 and 50 pairs [6]. In the 1996-2000 period, it was 0-5 pairs [7]. Now it is probably under 20 pairs. The species migrates until late in May, and in the middle of the month intensive migration is still observed. It is then found in many of the lakes near the Black Sea coast but this cannot be assumed as breeding. During migration it is found in the water basins throughout the country, and the flocks sometimes number hundreds of individuals [1].</p>
		<p><b>Habitats.</b> Freshwater stagnant water basins (marshes, lakes, fish farms), thickly overgrown with floating water vegetation. In the out-of-breeding period: basins of a different nature.</p>
		<p><b>Biology.</b> It incubates in colonies, rarely singularly. The nest is placed on the leaves of the floating vegetation, less often on tufts of reeds. Laying the eggs is at the end of May to the middle of June. The clutch usually contains 3 eggs. The young ones most frequently appear at the end of June. Nidifugous, they start flying after 18-21 days. Sexual maturity is reached not earlier than the second year. The food includes larvae of water insects, small crustaceans, etc. [1].</p>
		<p><b>Similar species.</b> The White-winged Black Tern (<i>Chlidonias leucopterus</i>), the Whiskered Tern (<i>Chlidonias hybridus</i>)<i>.</i>
		</p>
		<p><b>Negative factors.</b> Unclarified. Probably the impermanent water regime and the quality of the waters in the basins; reasons of an inter-species nature related to a general decrease of the numbers of the species in Europe.</p>
		<p><b>Conservation measures taken.</b> Protected according to the Biological Diversity Act. Srebarna Lake, where it breeds most often in larger numbers, is a reserve with an adopted Management Plan.</p>
		<p><b>Conservation measures needed.</b> Studies of the distribution of the species in the country and clarification of its preferences to the habitat. Maintenance of a permanent water regime in the Srebarna Reserve. Restoration of wetlands along the Danube (Belene and Kalimok), which will expand the opportunities for breeding. Restoration of the functioning of the larger fish farms in the country, where the species can also potentially nest.</p>

		<p><b>Distribution and abundance in Bulgaria.</b> A breeding summer visitor and passage migrant, as an exception wintering. At the end of the 19th century it was widely distributed [2]. Fifty years later, it was still numerous [3]. In the middle of 80s of the last century, only 5 422 breeding pairs [4] were registered. During the last count (2004-2005), 4 956 pairs were registered [5]. Most of the pairs (78,8%) breed at altitudes between 50 and 499 m. In Burgas Bay in the autumn of 1981, a total of 227 000 migrating birds from Central and Eastern Europe were registered [7], and in 2001 the most numerous flock of 28 700 individuals was reported [9]. Wintering birds are most frequently observed near the rivers Maritsa and Struma [10, 11].</p>
		<p><b>Habitats.</b> Mainly populated places in the low parts of the country and in the vicinity to rivers, rice fields, wet meadows, reservoirs, etc. In 1994/1995 only about 8% of the total number of nests were located outside human settlements [6].</p>
		<p><b>Biology.</b> The multiplying period is from the end of March to the beginning of August [7]. Trees were the preferred substrate for breeding in the past, at present these are electric posts (46,4 %), trees (29,8%), buildings (24,1%), etc. [6]. In regions with an abundant nutrition base there are also colonially breeding birds: the village of Belozem, Plovdiv region (16 nests on the school building) [8]; the village of Samuilovo, Sliven region (12 nests on oak trees); the village of Litakovo, Sofia region (9 nests on oak trees); the town of Ihtiman (7 nests on the school building), etc. [6].

		<p><b>Distribution and abundance in Bulgaria.</b> A breeding summer visitor and passage migrant, in the past widely distributed and frequently breeding in valleys and mountains [1]. For the 1950-1980 period it is considered that "it was found more and more rarely". The numbers are estimated at 50-100 pairs [2], which is probably a reduced assessment in view of the large number of new habitats found after 1990 [3, 4, 5, 6, 7]. At present, it is mainly found in hilly and low-mountainous parts of the country: the mountains Eastern Rhodopes [6, 7], Sakar [5], the Derventski Vazvisheniya (hills), Strandzha [3], Sredna gora [8], the Eastern Balkan range, the area in front of the Balkan range, the Ludogorie region [4]. Singular pairs have also been registered in the higher mountains and valleys: the mountains Rila and Pirin, the mountains on the western border, the Thracian lowland [9, 10], the valley of the Danube [4, 11]. Numbers are estimated at 300-360 pairs.</p>
		<p><b>Habitats.</b> Thinned deciduous and rarely coniferous forests close to open terrains, pastures and meadows.</p>
		<p><b>Biology.</b> It breeds on trees, mainly deciduous. The building of the nest is from the end of April to the beginning of May. It lays one egg. Young ones having just left their nest have been observed at the end of July and the beginning of August [2, 9, 10]. It mainly feeds on snakes, lizards and frogs, less often on small mammals and insects [2].</p>

		<p><b><i>Ciconia nigra</i></b> (Linnaeus, 1758)</p>
		<p>Order Ciconiiformes</p>
		<p>Family Ciconiidae</p>
		<p><b>Conservation status:</b> <i>in Bulgaria:</i>
			<b>Vulnerable VU</b> [D], BDA-II, III; <i>International:</i> CITES-II, BeC-II, BoC-II, ECS-Spec 3, BD-I.</p>
		<p><b>General distribution.</b> A Palearctic species. It breeds in almost all European countries (without Finland, Norway, Great Britain, Eire, Iceland, Switzerland and Cyprus), Asia (in the south to the Persian Gulf, in the east to Sahalin island) and South Africa. The European population numbers about 8 000 breeding pairs [1] .</p>
		<p><b>Distribution and abundance in Bulgaria.</b> A breeding summer visitor and passage migrant, it partly winters. In the middle of the 20th century it was on the threshold of extinction [2]. Thirty-five years later, the population was estimated at 50 pairs, 30 of them breeding along the valley of the Arda River [3]. At the end of the 20th century, during special studies, it was established that the population numbered 200-220 pairs. About 48% of them breed in the Rhodopes, in the valley of the middle reaches of the Tundzha River – 19%, in the valley of the Danube – 10%, etc. [4]. Recently, the population has been estimated at 300-550 breeding pairs [5]. In the rice fields to the north of Plovdiv, some several tens of birds have been regularly wintering since 1978, making this the first known wintering site of the species in the Western Palearctic [6, 7].</p>
		<p><b>Habitats.</b> Flat and mountainous deciduous forests, rock complexes, gorges of rivers, reservoirs, microreservoirs, fish farms, rice fields, etc. The largest number of breeding places (31%) is registered at altitudes between 600 and 800 m, and the smallest (0,5%) at altitudes between 1 200 and 1 300 m [4].</p>
		<p><b>Biology.</b> The spring migration is from the beginning of March to the beginning of April. The young ones (between 2 and 4) remain in the nest until the second half of July or the beginning of August. The autumn migration is from the second half of August to the end of October [8]. The late autumn and winter wanderings are from the beginning of November to the end of February. It mainly feeds on fish.</p>
		<p><b>Similar species.</b> The White Stork (<i>Ciconia ciconia</i>)<i>.</i>
		</p>
		<p><b>Negative factors.</b> Pollution of the wetlands, persecution in fish farms, etc.</p>
		<p><b>Conservation measures taken.</b> Protected according to the Biological Diversity Act. Included in the Red Data Book of Bulgaria (1985). For persecuting, disturbing, destroying or collecting eggs, collecting found dead birds, stuffing, sale, export, etc. the fine is up to 5 000 levs for physical persons, and for trade companies and legal personalities up to 10 000 levs.</p>
		<p><b>Conservation measures needed.</b> Monitoring of the population every 5 years. Establishment of the exact coordinates of every certain breeding habitat. Declaring new Protected Territories in connection with the guaranteed preservation of 20% of the breeding places in the country. Prevention of the dehydration of mountain rivers for the needs of small water power stations.</p>

		<p><b>Conservation status:</b> <i>in Bulgaria:</i>
			<b>Vulnerable VU</b>=C[a(i)+b], BDA-III; <i>International:</i> IUCN-LC, CITES-II, BeC-II, BoC-II, BD-I.</p>
		<p><b>General distribution.</b> A European-Turkestan species with numbers between 10 000 – 1 000 000 individuals. The European population is less than 65 000 pairs, with 50% of the breeding area.</p>
		<p><b>Distribution and abundance in Bulgaria.</b> A breeding summer visitor, passage migrant and winter visitor. Until 1985, it was found throughout the country during migration, more often along the Black Sea coast [1]; during the winter, singular individuals were reported [2]. At present, breeding is proved for many regions of Western Bulgaria (including the Sofia field), the valley of the river Maritsa and Southeastern Bulgaria [3]. Territories with the highest breeding density are the Derventski Vazvisheniya (hills), the regions of the Malko Sharkovo reservoir, Yambol region, and Stara Zagora field. Its numbers for 1990 are estimated at not more than 30-50 pairs [3] 30-60 pairs for 1997 [4], and in 2004 up to 180-220 pairs [5]. According to other estimates, the total numbers are 220-270 breeding pairs [3].</p>
		<p><b>Habitats.</b> Various wetlands (including wet meadows, marshes, turf areas) to which it shows a marked preference. In Bulgaria it often breeds in arable areas, most frequently sown with wheat. Outside the multiplication period, the connection with the wetlands weakens considerably [6].</p>
		<p><b>Biology.</b> It breeds singularly or in thinned colonies. It migrates singularly or in pairs, especially in the autumn, sometimes forming small flocks with other hawks when crossing large water areas [6]. It feeds on eggs and the young of birds breeding on the ground, rodents, small hares, lizards, large insects [6].</p>
		<p><b>Similar species.</b> The Pallid Harrier (<i>Circus macrourus</i>).</p>
		<p><b>Negative factors.</b> The major threat for the nests in arable lands is the destruction of the clutch during harvesting. To a lower degree it is threatened by the loss of habitats, disturbance, clashing with high-voltage lines and wind turbines, illegal shooting by poachers, poisoning.</p>
		<p><b>Conservation measures taken.</b> Protected according to the Biological Diversity Act. Included in the Red Data Book of Bulgaria (1985). Current campaigns against illegal shooting by poachers and the use of pesticides, inclusion of the habitats of some of the species in the National Ecological Network. Giving aid to wounded birds in the Centre for Rehabilitation and Multiplication of Rare Species in the city of Stara Zagora.</p>
		<p><b>Conservation measures needed.</b> Annual mapping of the breeding colonies, especially those larger than 10 pairs, localizing the nests and their protection by enclosing them (with bales of hay) in a radius of 15 m. Postponing the harvesting in cases of localizing larger colonies, compensations paid to land owners for losses as a result of conservation measures taken.</p>

Since the end of the 20th and the beginning of the 21st century, in most places where the species was registered, individuals with the phenotypical features of the Rock Pidgeon and different hybrids forms of the Rock Dove (<i>Columba livia var. domestica</i>) have been found living together. Spearate small colonies in which all the individuals have the phenotypical features characteristic of the Rock Pidgeon (<i>C. livia</i>) have also been found. It is highly unlikely for them not to hybridize with domesic pidgeons in the near future. The last estimation of the numbers was between 400 and 1 000 pairs [4].</p>
		<p><b>Habitats.</b> Rocky regions with vertical walls, rarely on high slopes of earth banks, mainly in the flat, low mountainous and middle mountainous zone; the central mountainous zone, very rare in the sub-Alpine and the Alpine zone. It prefers vertical rock slopes with a well-marked relief (with niches, holes, cracks, cronices, etc.), and in the past also precipice caves with large entrance openings.</p>
		<p><b>Biology.</b> It breeds in shelters in ceilings and walls of caves with large entrances, rock bridges; in holes, cracks, protected cornices along open vertical rock slopes. The nest is built of small branches, herbaceous stems, small roots, etc. In most cases it forms colonies: from 3-4 to several tens of pairs. Sometimes it breeds in the close vicinity of Eurasian Jackdaws, Kestrels and Alpine Swifts; in the past also Alpine Choughs [3]. The courting period begins in March-April [2]. The full clutch consists of 2 white eggs. The incubation lasts for 17-18 days, at the age of 30-35 days the young ones leave the nest [2]. Yearly it breeds two generaltions. In the hybrid forms in nature – in colonies at lower altitudes (personal data), a strongly extended and even permanent multiplication cycle is observed. It mainly feeds on seeds of various herbaceous plants.</p>
		<p><b>Similar species.</b> The Hill Pigeon (<i>Columba rupestris</i>) [6].</p>
		<p><b>Negative factors.</b> Hybridization with different breeds of domestic doves. Change of the habitats for feeding as a result of changed agricultural practices in the last several decades. Illegal shooting.</p>
		<p><b>Conservation measures taken.</b> Protected according to the Biological Diversity Act.</p>
		<p><b>Conservation measures needed.</b> Doing genetic research on the species. Multiplication in zoological parks and multiplication centres. Studying foreign experience on the problem of its hybridization. Carrying out focused long-term studies on the species in nature.</p>

		<p><b>Distribution and abundance in Bulgaria.</b> Resident and passage migrant. In the past it was distributed throughout the country [1]. In Northern Bulgaria it started declining in the 1940s [2], and until 1980 also on the larger part of its breeding territory [3]. The decline in numbers was reported in 87 forestries (G. Spiridonov, L. Mileva – unpublished information from the Bulgarian Forestries Questionnaire, 1989). Its breeding territory considerably decreased in the mountains Western and Central Balkans, Sredna Gora and on the western border of Bulgaria, as well as in the Ludogorie region. There are no changes in Strandzha and the Rila-Rhodope massif [3, 4]. The numbers are estimated at 250 – 400 breeding pairs [5].</p>

		<p><b>Biology.</b> It arrives in February-April and leaves in October-November. Some birds winter in the country. Its breeding period is from the middle of March until the middle of August [3, 9]; it breeds in hollows of the black wood pecker or in hollows of trees at a height of up to 25 m, rarely in rocks [10, 11, 12]. It has 2 or 3 clutches, usually with 2 eggs each; in Russia up to 4 clutches [13]. It incubates for 16-18 days, mainly the female bird. The young ones stay in the nest for 27-28 days, sometimes only 20 [10]. In an old beech forest in the Central Balkan range on an area of 45 ha, 4 breeding pairs were found [14]. A density of 0,2-4 pairs/1 000 ha is given for most of the area [6].</p>

		<p><b>General distribution.</b> Probably a European species. Its natural area in the north reaches Great Britain, the Scandinavian peninsula, Arhangelsk, Siberia, in the south the Pyrenees, France, Italy, Yugoslavia, Bulgaria, the Northern Black Sea coast with the Crimean peninsula, Armenia, the Caspian Sea; the eastern border is Lake Baikal.</p>
		<p><b>Distribution and abundance in Bulgaria.</b> A breeding summer visitor and passage migrant. At the end of the 19th century it was comparatively rare (the areas of the cities of Pazardzhik and Sofia) [1, 2]. In the middle of the previous century, it was common on wet meadows around the marshes [3], but later it was again specified as endangered [4]. Historically, there are 3 fluctuations of the numbers in connection with deforestation leading to the emergence of appropriate habitats. The following intensification of agriculture caused a drastic decrease of the numbers [6]. At present, there is a mosaic distribution mainly in Western Bulgaria [7, 8, 9]. The more significant habitats are in the Sofia region: about 850 courting males, the Western and the Central Balkan range, 1500, Ponor Planina mountain, 120, along the Tran-Breznik line to the border, 250. It has comparatively low numbers along the Danube banks and the Black Sea coast, in Dobrudzha and the Eastern Rhodopes. The total numbers in the country are between 4 000 and 6 000 pairs [6].</p>
		<p><b>Habitats.</b> Wet and mesophytic herbaceous associations with a domination of <i>Poa pratensis, Alopecurus pratensis, Gallium aparine</i>, etc. [10], between 500 and 1 800 m, but it has also been registered at an altitude of 2 500 m [11].</p>
		<p><b>Biology.</b> Understudied. The males are strongly territorial. The area of the individual sectors is 8,9 ha, at the average. It feeds on insects: mainly grass-hoppers, also worms and slugs [13, 14].</p>
		<p><b>Similar species.</b> The species of the genus <i>Porzana</i> and the genus <i>Rallus</i>.</p>
		<p><b>Negative factors.</b> Destruction of the habitats, mowing, burning stubble-fields. Intensification of agriculture, insecticides, destruction of habitats – ploughing the meadows, early mowing (in June and July); infrastructure development; hunting.</p>
		<p><b>Conservation measures taken.</b> Protected according to the Biological Diversity Act. Included in the Red Data Book of Bulgaria (1985). A plan has been prepared for the preservation of the species. The more significant habitats are declared Important Bird Areas and included in <i>Natura 2000</i>. The marshes Dolni Bogrov and Dragoman have been declared Protected Localities.</p>
		<p><b>Conservation measures needed.</b> Protection of the more significant habitats in the separate regions of the country; monitoring of the populations every 5 years; yearly monitoring of the more significant habitats; a special mowing regime in the habitats from the centre to the periphery of the field.</p>

		<p><b>Conservation status:</b> <i>in Bulgaria:</i> Vulnerable VU [B1], BDA-II, III; <i>International:</i> IUCN [LR/lc], BeC-II, HD-IV.</p>
		<p><b>General distribution.</b> From Belgium through Central, Eastern and Southeastern Europe, Western Siberia and Northern Kazakhstan to the upper courses of the Yenisei and the Altai, part of China.</p>
		<p><b>Distribution and abundance in Bulgaria.</b> Northern Bulgaria. The country belongs to the regions where the species has a predomination of low numbers [1].</p>
		<p><b>Habitats.</b> A steppe species. In the European part of its range, it prefers agricultural areas in the lowlands and the valleys (at altitudes under 600 m) with a predominance of perennial herbaceous cultures on heavy soils with a considerable participation of a clay component with a total thickness of at least 1 m and a depth of underground waters under 1.2 m. Its abundance in cultivated areas is higher in comparison with the "wild" herbaceous habitats [2, 3].</p>
		<p><b>Biology.</b> It lives singularly in its own system of tunnels, with a depth of over 2 m [4]. It hibernates during winter but in warm weather awakens and goes onto the surface [2]. It feeds on green parts of plants, roots, seeds and fruits [2] and on invertebrates and small vertebrates [5]. It breeds during the warm period of the year. Pregnancy lasts for 17 days. One female yields 2 to 3 litters yearly, each with 2 - 10 (18) young ones. Sexual maturity is reached after the first wintering [1, 6, 7]. The duration of life does not exceed 4 years [6]. It falls prey to predatory mammals and rapacious birds [8, 9, 10]. It competes with the Romanian hamster.</p>
		<p><b>Similar species.</b> The Romanian hamster (<i>Mesocricetus newtoni</i>), but the European hamster is larger, the lower part of the body is entirely black.</p>
		<p><b>Negative factors.</b> Industrialization of agriculture, as a result of which the areas with perennial cultures decrease in number, the seeds are treated with pesticides, the fields are ploughed immediately after harvesting and are treated with rodenticides on a mass scale [11, 12, 13]. The switch-over to private agriculture and the fragmentation of the lands associated with it and their intensive processing, with the use of considerable quantities of fertilizers and pesticides.</p>
		<p><b>Conservation measures taken.</b> Included in the Red Data Book of Bulgaria, 1985, the Biological Diversity Act, Annexes 2 and 3 and the Berne Convention, Annex II.</p>
		<p><b>Conservation measures needed.</b> A programme for the assessment of the contemporary state of the species in Bulgaria must be developed and implemented. On that basis, a preservation plan must be worked out. Creation of "agrarian reserves": territories with an optimal structure for the arable lands in which agricultural practices harmful for the European hamster should not be employed. These measures should be stimulated by a system of compensations for farmers.</p>

		<p><b>General distribution.</b> From Eastern and Southeastern Europe through Asia Minor, the Caucasus Mountains and Kazakhstan to Mongolia and part of China, in the south to Israel, Iraq, Iran and Pakistan.</p>
		<p><b>Distribution and abundance in Bulgaria.</b> Eastern Bulgaria, a rare species with low numbers. During the first catching of the species in Bulgaria, it was represented by 3, with respect to the total of 827 individuals of small mammals caught in Southeastern Bulgaria [1]. Its quantity in owl pellets [2, 3] is also extremely low. Judging from its finding in pellets from Southeastern Bulgaria in the recent years, it can be assumed that its population status is unchanged.</p>
		<p><b>Habitats.</b> The initial (natural) habitats are of a steppe and semi-steppe nature. In the northern part of its range it inhabits the lowlands but in the southern one it climbs high in the mountains. In Bulgaria it inhabits field margins and virgin lands overgrown with grass and low shrubs, amongst fields, the environs of low-stem deciduous forests, young orchards and vineyards [1, 4].</p>
		<p><b>Biology.</b> It digs out holes with a simple structure, often with two entrances and one chamber, at a depth of 20 cm to 1 m. It does not hibernate, although its activity decreases during the winter [5]. It is active during the night. It feeds on seeds of grasses, fruits [1, 4], rarely beetles and snails [6]. In the warm period of the year it yields up to three generations [7]. The number of the young in a litter are from 4 to 7. The young from the earlier generations start taking part in the breeding as early as the same season [8]. In many regions it has low numbers, especially in the northern and western parts of its range [9]. Considerable death-rate is caused by climatic factors: for example, cold winters with little snow, cold rains in the spring and autumn. Its major enemies are small rapacious mammals and nocturnal rapacious birds [2]. A probable competitor is the yellow-necked mouse, widely distributed in Bulgaria.</p>
		<p><b>Similar species.</b> None.</p>
		<p><b>Negative factors.</b> It is found in regions with a predominant traditional agriculture whose intensity in the recent years was low. Switching over to private agriculture and the fragmentation of the areas and their intensive processing associated with it, and the employment of considerable quantities of fertilizers and pesticides probably have a negative effect. The northwestern habitats are in the industrially degraded region of Stara Zagora – Radnevo – Maritsa Iztok. The enormous infrastructure facilities, the open mines, the dense road network, etc. have undoubtedly destroyed some of the habitats of the species.</p>
		<p><b>Conservation measures taken.</b> It is included in the Red Data Book of Bulgaria, 1985, in the category <i>rare species</i>, and in the Biological Diversity Act, Annexes 2 and 3.</p>

		<p><b>Distribution and abundance in Bulgaria.</b> In the past, it was common in all fresh and brackish water: rivers, marshes and lakes belonging to the basins of the Danube River, the Aegean Sea and the Black Sea [1, 2, 3, 4]. In the middle of the last decade, races of cultivated carp from Romania, the former Yugoslavia, Hungary and other countries were introduced to Bulgaria. Gradually, the cultivated carp was spread all over the Bulgarian water bodies. At present, the wild common carp can be found in Durankulak Lake – in the zone of Orlovo Blato marsh, which in the 1960s was separated by a dike from the rest of the lake, and where cultivated carp has not been introduced [our data]. The wild form is probably also found in some isolated water bodies, such as the Dyavolsko Blato marsh, some river arms, etc.</p>
		<p><b>Habitats.</b> It inhabits lower reaches of rivers, permanent fresh water marshes and lakes and coastal fresh water lagoons.</p>
		<p><b>Biology.</b> The species reaches sexual maturity at the age of 3-4 years [5]. Spawning occurs in the second half of May and June at water temperature of 18°C [1]. Eggs are deposited repeatedly on submerged vegetation. The fecundity varies from 200 000 to 1 200 000 eggs. It feeds on insect larvae, crustaceans, mollusks, worms and aquatic plants [1, 5].</p>
		<p><b>Similar species.</b> The crucian carp (<i>Carassius carassius</i>) and the giebel carp (<i>C. gibelio</i>). The wild common carp can be distinguished by the presence of two pairs of barbels at the corners of the mouth.</p>

		<p><b>Distribution and abundance in Bulgaria.</b> A rarely wintering species, represented in Bulgaria by the subspecies <i>Cygnus columbianus bewickii </i>Yarrell, 1830. It was found for the first time near Durankulak Lake [1]. In the period until 1985 it was reported only near Atanasovsko Ezero lake [3]. After 1989 it regularly winters in small numbers mainly along the Black Sea coast, less frequently near water basins in Northern and Southern Bulgaria. Major wintering places are the wet agricultural terrains around Mandrensko Lake, near the mouth of the river Fakiyska, where its highest numbers in Bulgaria were registered: 84 individuals on 15 February 1997 [4]. For the region of the Burgas lakes it shows a tendency for an increase of the wintering population.

		<p><b>Distribution and abundance in Bulgaria.</b> Resident. Until the middle of the 20th century it was found in all mountains [1]. In 1980, breeding places in some mountains were confirmed [2]. It breeds in the Central and Western Balkan range, Sredna Gora, Rila, Pirin, the Western Rhodopes, Strandzha and in some isolated breeding places [2; 3; 4; 5; Shurulinkov – unpublished information]. Numbers: 700 – 1 100 pairs, mosaically on a forest area of about 450 thousand ha with an average density of 400-650 ha/pairs; for the Balkan peninsula the data [6] are exaggerated; most probably the breeding pairs are 2 000 – 3 500.</p>
		<p><b>Habitats.</b> Old beech, beech-coniferous and oak forests at altitudes of up to 1700 m, with more dead and dying trees [2].</p>
		<p><b>Biology.</b> The clutches (3-7 eggs) are in April and May. It incubates for 14-16 days, the young ones staying in the nest for 27-28 days [7]. At the end of June feeding of young birds before their flying away from the nest was observed – in a hollow of a pine-spruce some 20 m away [Spiridonov, unpubl. data], in June – young ones having flown out of the nest [8; 9]. 90 % of the food consists of insects-xylophages and their larvae [10; 11; 12; 13].

		<p><b>Biology.</b> A predator feeding on water insects, tadpoles and small fish. It assumes a hunting pose on a leaf of the vegetation, the front legs lying on the water surface. Its hunting skills do not rule out persectution of the victim on the surface of the water. The breeding period includes July-August. After the copulation, the female makes a cocoon that it carries for about 3 weeks. After the third month it makes a "child's net" on which the young ones hatch. After the second moulting the young ones leave the shelter and settle on the surrounding vegetation. They become adult in 2 years, and breed from the third year. The female dies at the end of the summer and the male earlier.</p>

		<p><b>General distribution.</b> A Palearctic species inhabiting the taiga and the zone of the deciduous forests in Eurasia. A glacial relict. Comparatively rare in the Balkan Peninsula.</p>
		<p><b>Distribution and abundance in Bulgaria.</b> Resident. Until the 1950s, it was widely distributed in the mountainous and flat forests [1]. In 1980, there were data of finding it in the Balkan range, the Rila-Rhodope massif, the mountains Strandzha and Sredna Gora, less often in the valleys; according to an expert appraisal, about 1 000 pairs [2]. Later studies showed a larger distribution in the mountains and new habitats in the valleys [3; Shurulinkov, personnal communication]. The area inhabited is about 2 mln ha [4]. Depending on the quality of the forests, at an average density from 500 to 2 000 ha/1 pairs, the numbers for Bulgaria are 1 500 – 2 000 pairs; in the Western Rhodopes 470-530, the Central and the Western Balkan range 300-400, Rila mountain (130-170), Strandzha mountain (100-130) [2; 5; 6; 7; 8; 9; 10; 11].</p>
		<p><b>Biology.</b> The pairs do not separate for the winter [11]. The multiplication period is from the middle of February until the middle of March. The nesting chamber is dug out in the trunk of a tree with a diameter over 40 cm and at a height over 4 m, or old breeding chambers and hollows for spending nights are used. It lays in April (3-6 eggs), incubates for 12-14 days, the young ones fly away 24-31 days after hatching; if the clutch is lost, it breeds for the second time [8, 11, 12, 13]. The food includes bark-eating beetles, their larvae and ants [8, 9, 10]. The sectors of the pairs in old coniferous forests are about 300 ha, in beech forests 400, and in oak forest 500-600 ha [5, 6, 7]; there are similar data for Central Europe and Russia. In forests with few dying and large-sized trees, the sector has an area of 1 000 – 1 600 ha [8; 9; 14].</p>
		<p><b>Habitats.</b> It prefers vast old coniferous, beech and mixed forests (up to 2 100 m) [1, 6, 7, 8, 11, 14].</p>
		<p><b>Negative factors.</b> Felling old forests and sanitary felling. Decrease of the nutrition base, in particular of the red ant. Competition by the Grey-headed Woodpecker, the White-backed Woodpecker and the Green Woodpecker. The narrow specialization to feeding and habitat.</p>
		<p><b>Conservation measures taken.</b> The species and its habitats are protected according to the Biological Diversity Act. Included in the Red Data Book of Bulgaria (1985) in the category <i>rare</i>. About 20% of the multiplying pairs inhabit National Parks and Natural Parks.</p>

		<h1>Four-lined Snake</h1>
		<p><b><i>Elaphe quatuorlineata</i></b> (Lacepede, 1789)</p>
		<p>Order Squamata</p>
		<p>Family Colubridae</p>
		<p><b>Conservation status:</b> <i>in Bulgaria:</i>
			<b>Endangered EN </b>[B1, C2a(i)], BDA-II, III; <i>International</i>: BeC-II, HD-II, IV.</p>
		<p><b>General distribution.</b> Italy, the whole western coast of the Balkan peninsula, the western half of Greece and many of the Greek islands, Macedonia and the southwestern corner of Bulgaria.</p>
		<p><b>Distribution and abundance in Bulgaria.</b> It has been found only in the Petrich-Sandanski valley, the valley of the river Strumeshnitsa and the southern half of the Kresna gorge [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. In the flat parts of the Petrich-Sandanski gorge it is almost destroyed because of the large share of arable areas and has remained mainly in the feet of the surrounding mountains and some rocky hills situated in an island-like manner. In the Kresna gorge it has been found at altitudes up to 600 m [3]. The numbers and the density of the populations are unknown. In 1971-1975 in the region of the village of Gorna Breznitsa (Kresna municipality), among 437 non-selectively gathered snakes this species takes the 7th place in the frequency of finding [3].</p>
		<p><b>Habitats.</b> Mainly low-stem forests and bushes in rocky and other places with a well-developed microrelief, on slopes lit by the sun.</p>
		<p><b>Biology.</b> In the second half of June and the beginning of July, it lays 5-14 eggs [3]. It mainly feeds on birds and their eggs, less often rodents, sometimes swallowing newly-born hares, small hedge-hogs and newly-hatched tortoises. It reaches a length of 180 cm, rarely 200. It is not poisonous.</p>
		<p><b>Similar species.</b> In Bulgaria none. The young ones are spotted and are hard to distinguish from those of the blotched snake (<i>Elaphe sauromates</i>), but the two species are geographically isolated from the high mountains in Southwestern Bulgaria. After "taking off" the horn layer of its skin several times, at a length of about 60 to about 95 cm, they gradually acquire a striped colouring.</p>
		<p><b>Negative factors.</b> Intensive agriculture in the Petrich-Sandanski valley; killing by local people; illegal gathering by collectors and terrarium keepers; running over on the roads.</p>
		<p><b>Conservation measures taken</b>. Included in the Bulgarian Red Data Book of 1985 in the endangered category. A poster was published for the protection of reptiles in 1998; articles have been published to popularize its protection in editions with a large circulation. Almost all habitats fall within the <i>Natura 2000</i> network of protected territories.</p>
		<p><b>Conservation measures needed.</b> Popularization of the nature conservation status of the species, especially in the regions where it is found; control over the activities of poachers; disallowing building a motorway in the Kresna gorge; discontinuation of the quarry development of the volcanic hill Kozhuha near Petrich.</p>

		<p><b>Conservation status:</b> <i>in Bulgaria:</i> <b>Endagered EN</b> [A4ac], BDA-II, III; <i>International:</i> BeC-II, HD-II, IV.</p>
		<p><b>General distribution.</b> From Southwestern and Danubian Romania and the eastern parts of the Balkan peninsula to Western Kazakhstan, Western Iran and Northern Iraq; in the north up to the middle course of the Don and the region of Volgograd, in the south the area includes Southern Russia, the countries of the Caucasus Region, Turkey.</p>
		<p><b>Distribution and abundance in Bulgaria.</b> At the end of the 19th and the first decade of the 20th century, it was common in Northern Bulgaria and the eastern parts of Southern Bulgaria [1, 2, 3]. Many habitats have been reported from these regions, found in the 1920s and 1930s [4]. In the last fifty years, there were only several sure cases of findings to the north of the Balkan range and in the western half of the Upper Thracian lowland. Comparatively preserved are the populations at places in the Eastern Rhodopes, the Tundzha region, Sakar and Strandzha, but there the species is also rare. It has also been found in new habitats in Northern Bulgaria (Nikopol region), Shumen region [5], the Black Sea coast between the river Batova and the village of Kiten, the Besaparski hills to the south of Pazardzhik, the regions of Asenovgrad, Haskovo, Svilengrad, Sredets. All the habitats in Bulgaria are at altitudes of up to 400 m (unpublished data).</p>
		<p><b>Habitats.</b> Mainly places with thin forests and bushes or with steppe vegetation, where it prefers hollows, ravines, etc. It also enters the edges of marshes while looking for nests of birds.</p>
		<p><b>Biology.</b> Diurnally active. Its basic food in the spring are eggs and the young of birds, and rodents in the summer and in the autumn. It lays 4-14 eggs. In their colouring, the young ones resemble the adults but they have less yellow pigment in the colouring. It reaches a length of 180 cm, rarely 200 cm. It is not poisonous.</p>
		<p><b>Similar species.</b> In their colouring, the young ones resemble the cat snake (<i>Telescopus fallax</i>) but are easily distinguished from it by their round eye pupil.</p>
		<p><b>Negative factors.</b> In Northern Bulgaria and the western parts of Thrace: the creation of large monocultural fields in the second half of the 20th century and, as a result, the elimination of the field boundaries, the small forests, the bushes in the hollows, etc.; a decrease of the areas of deciduous forests in the Eastern Rhodopes, Sakar and Strandzha, forestation with coniferous trees, forest fires; the tourist invasion along the Black Sea coast, building along the coast; death by cars on the roads; illegal catching.</p>
		<p><b>Conservation measures taken.</b> Some of the habitats fall within protected territories (the Srebarna reserve, the natural parks Rusenski Lom, Strandzha, Poda protected locality near Burgas, etc.); a poster was published for the protection of reptiles (1998).</p>
		<p><b>Conservation measures needed.</b> Popularization of the nature conservation status of the species; inclusion of the habitats in protected territories; restriction on felling trees and forestation with coniferous species in the existing habitats; combating forest fires; strict control over the activities of local and foreign human poachers.</p>

		<h1>Virgin mayfly</h1>
		<p><b><i>Ephoron virgo</i></b> (Olivier, 1791)</p>
		<p><i>Polymitarcis virgo </i>(Olivier, 1791): Russev, 1957: 555.</p>
		<p>Order Mayflies (Ephemeroptera)</p>
		<p>Family Pale burrowing mayflies (Polymitarcyidae)</p>
		<p><b>Conservation status:</b> <i>in Bulgaria</i>: <b>Extinct EX</b>.</p>
		<p><b>General distribution.</b> Spain, France, Belgium, Germany, Italy, Austria, Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria, Southern Russia.</p>
		<p><b>Distribution and abundance in Bulgaria.</b> It is known from 18 localities in the interior rivers (few specimens between 1950 and 1987) and from about 20 localities along the Bulgarian section of the Danube (more numerous subpopulations) [1, 2, 3, 4]. For the last time, it was recorded in the Bulgarian section of the Danube in 1971 [5]. In the interior rivers, it has occurred in tributaries of the Danube (Ogosta, Iskar, Osam, Yantra), in Tundzha (and its tributary Popovska River) and rivers from the Black Sea basin (Kamchiya, Sredetska, Veleka). The last records of the species are from Southeastern Bulgaria: Popovska River near the village of Dobrich in the area of Elhovo, in June 1987, Sredetska River at Debelt Village near Grudovo in June 1987, Veleka River at Gramatikovo Village near Malko Tarnovo in August 1983. During current investigations of these rivers and localities, the species has not been recorded [6, 7, 8, unpublished data].</p>
		<p><b>Habitats.</b> The larvae are burrowing. Typical inhabitants of large rivers with clay-sandy bottoms [1], they prefer a mixed substrate composed of larger and finer materials [9]. They live on or in the river sediment where they dig out U-shaped tunnels.</p>
		<p><b>Biology.</b> One generation yearly. In winter, the eggs are in diapause that terminates in the spring with the rise of the temperature [10]. The nymphs feed on detritus and algae that they filtrate from the water. After their development to the last instar, they swim out onto the surface and fly away, developing into a subimago and then into an adult. The adults swarm over the rivers after dusk (August and September) [1]. They mate in flight, after which the females lay about 2000-3000 eggs on the surface of the water [11].</p>
		<p><b>Similar species.</b> <i>Palingenia longicauda</i>. It differs in the shape of the elongation of mandibula, which in <i>Ephoron virgo</i> is wedge-like, drawn out forward.</p>
		<p><b>Negative factors.</b> Pollution of the Bulgarian Danube tributaries and of the Danube with domestic and industrial waste waters. The extraction of inert materials from the bottoms of rivers.</p>
		<p><b>Conservation measures taken.</b> None.</p>

		<p><b>Conservation status:</b> <i>in Bulgaria:</i>
			<b>Vulnerable VU</b> [A4 a,c,e], BDA-III; <i>International:</i> BeC-II.</p>
		<p><b>General distribution.</b> A Holarctic species with 40 subspecies in the Holarctic and partly Latin America. The subspecies <i>E. a. balcanica </i>is endemic for the Balkan peninsula, after 1960 it has also been breeding in the Southern Carpathians [1].</p>
		<p><b>Distribution and abundance in Bulgaria.</b> Resident, during the autumn-winter period wandering also in the valleys. In the past it was numerous in the mountains – the Balkan range, Rila, Pirin, Slavyanka and the Western Rhodopes [2]. The numbers were not estimated. It also breeds in the mountains Sredna Gora, Vasilyovska Planina and Vitosha, and in the Western Rhodopes in the mountains Batashka Planina, Pelerik, Bukova Planina and Dabrash [3]. The breeding territory is about 70 000 ha, but below 2 200 – 2 400 m it is also inhabited by the skylark <i>Alauda arvensis.</i> The density of the populations in the country is 0,3 – 1 breeding pairs/ 10 ha [4; Spiridonov, unpublished information], and the numbers are 3 000 – 4 200 breeding pairs. The whole population of the subspecies is about 5 000 – 10 000 pairs [5].</p>
		<p><b>Habitats.</b> Meadows and pastures, including stony and rocky terrains, in the high-mountainous zone without forests, mainly on the sunlit slopes and ridges, less often in the zone of the forests, rarely under 1 400 m.</p>
		<p><b>Biology.</b> It multiplies from May to July but it appears that the Balkan subspecies has clutches in the lower parts of the mountains and in April. Feeding of a young bird that had already flown was registered on 3 May [6]. The nest is made in a hole in the ground, hidden amongst grass tufts and stones. It has 2 clutches yearly with 3-4 (up to 6) eggs each time [2; 7]. The females incubate. With other subspecies incubation lasts for 10-14 days, and the period of stay of the young ones in the nests is 9-12 days [7]. Food: seeds, in the summer insects and centipedes [2]. The breeding territory of the pairs in the mountains Central Balkan range and Northeastern Rila is 3-5 ha [4; 8; Spiridonov, unpublished information].</p>
		<p><b>Similar species.</b> The subspecies <i>Eremophila alpestris flava.</i>
		</p>
		<p><b>Negative factors.</b> The succession of the Siberian juniper and the forest in the meadows after the decay of mountain sheep breeding in the last 20 years [9]. Competition by the Skylark. Poisoning by seeds treated with pesticides during the autumn wanderings is also possible.</p>
		<p><b>Conservation measures taken.</b> Protected according to the Biological Diversity Act. Declaration of the mountains Pirin, Rila and the Central Balkans as National Parks, Vitosha mountain, the Rila Monastery and Balgarka as Natural Parks, and the buffer zone of the Alibotush Reserve. The action plans of the National Parks allow moderate pastures, maintaining the mountainous meadows and restriction of the juniper.</p>
		<p><b>Conservation measures needed.</b> Declaration of natural parks in the Western mountains Balkan range, Sredna Gora, the Western Rhodopes, Pirin and of protected territories for separate habitats of the species. Restriction of the invasion of the bush vegetation into important breeding habitats of the species.</p>

		<p>Order Squamata</p>
		<p>Family Boidae</p>
		<p><b>Conservation status:</b> <i>in Bulgaria:</i> <b>Endangered EN</b> [B1], BDA-III; <i>International</i>: BeC-III, CITES-II, HD-IV.</p>
		<p><b>General distribution.</b> In Europe – sporadically in the eastern and the southern half of the Balkan peninsula (with isolated habitats in Romanian Dobrudzha and Northern Bulgaria), many of the islands in the Aegean Sea and the Ionian Sea, and also the lands between the Stavropol region of Russia and the region of Baku; in Northern Africa between Morocco and Egypt; in Asia from Turkey to Eastern Iran and Saudi Arabia.</p>
		<p><b>Distribution and abundance in Bulgaria.</b> Sporadically distributed in the Danube valley [1], the Petrich-Sandanski valley [2, 3], the Thracian lowland [4, 5], the Eastern Rhodopes [6, 7], Sakar [8]. New habitats are found near the village of Vabel (Nikopol region), Asenovgrad, the Besaparskite hills (Pazardzhik region) near the villages of Byaga and Ognyanovo, the Rupite locality near Petrich, Marino Pole (Petrich region), the village of Manolovo (municipality Pavel Banya), the village of Binkos (municipality Sliven), the village of Radovets (Topolovgrad region). 1-3 individuals are known from most habitats. Changes in the numbers in Bulgaria are hard to be found, because the javelin sand boa leads a clandestine, semi-underground way of life.</p>
		<p><b>Habitats.</b> Low, dry and sunlit places, often of a semi-desert nature, with poor vegetation and crumbly soils, usually scattered with rock blocks and plates.</p>
		<p><b>Biology.</b> It mainly feeds on rodents and lizards that it kills by stifling. At the end of the summer it gives birth to several young ones. It rarely reaches a length of up to 75 cm. It is not poisonous.</p>
		<p><b>Similar species.</b> Among the Bulgarian ones none.</p>
		<p><b>Negative factors.</b> Gathering by collectors; some of the habitats in the Harmanli region and the Petrich-Sandanski valley are devastated; forestation of the habitats with coniferous trees (near Sandanski) and acacia trees (near the village of Tatari, Svishtov region) plantations. Probably also forest fires.</p>
		<p><b>Conservation measures taken.</b> Included in the Bulgarian Red Data Book, 1985, in the endangered category. Some of the habitats (the Rupite locality, near Asenovgrad) are in protected territories. A poster was published for the protection of reptiles in Bulgaria in 1998.</p>
		<p><b>Conservation measures needed.</b> Strict control and sanctioning poachers – collectors of reptiles; popularization of the nature conservation status of the species; preservation of the present state of the habitats and elimination of the negative factors in them; territorial protection of the sites with the largest numbers and dense populations.</p>

		<p><b>Distribution and abundance in Bulgaria.</b> A local endemic known only from the Vodnata Peshtera cave at the railway station of the village of Tserovo (Svoge municipality), where it is very rare [1, 2]. Only one female individual is known, caught on 28.09.1962 [1].

		<p><b>Similar species.</b> None.</p>
		<p><b>Negative factors.</b> In the last 50-60 years, the Vodnata cave has been used as a water source for the village of Tserovo. Many meliorative activities were carried out along the ridge of Ponor mountain that contributed to the reduction of the output of some of the karstic springs in the mountain. It is possible for these activities to have had a negative effect on the numbers of the species.</p>

		<p><b>General distribution.</b> The species has occurred in the basins of the rivers Volga, Vistula, Kuban, Don, Dnieper, Dniester, Prut and the Danube. It has been recorded in Austria, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Romania, Russia, Slovakia, Serbia, the Ukraine, Hungary and the Czech Republic.</p>
		<p><b>Distribution and abundance in Bulgaria.</b> In the first half of the previous century, the species was found in some of the Danube tributaries – the rivers Vit, Osam, Iskar and Mindevska (a tributary of the Yantra River), as well as in the Danube River near Lom, Oryahovo, Somovit and Ruse [1, 2, 3, 4] (in most sources the species is published as <i>Eudontomyzon danfordi </i>or <i>Lampetra planeri</i>). There are data that it also inhabited the rivers Zlatna Panega and Rusenski Lom [5]. The lampreys had been considered extinct in Bulgaria for a long time [6], since their finding in the Danube River was last reported in the 1960s [7, 8] (published as <i>E. danfordi</i>). Recently, single specimens in the larval stage have been recorded again in the Bulgarian section of the river: near Ruse [5], as well as near Silistra and Belene [our data].</p>
		<p><b>Habitats.</b> The species inhabits only permanent rivers. Spawning takes place in the upper and middle reaches of rivers over sandy and gravel bottom. The larvae live in calm waters (lower reaches) on sandy and muddy substrate.</p>
		<p><b>Biology.</b> Spawning is from the end of April to the middle of May [9]. A non-parasitic species. It spends from 4 to 6 years as larval form, feeding on detritus and phytoplankton (mainly diatoms). After the metamorphosis the adults do not feed. They migrate upstream and spawn in clear water with a strong current and sandy or gravel substrate. Soon after spawning, the adult individuals die. They have a life span of between 4.8 and 7.2 years [10].</p>
		<p><b>Similar species.</b> In many published sources, the only species of non-parasitic lamprey reported in Bulgaria is the European brook lamprey <i>L. planeri </i>[1, 4, 6]. This species, however, is known to occur only in the waters of Western Europe. Therefore, the individuals from Bulgaria identified as <i>L. planeri </i>must be considered as <i>E. mariae </i>[5, 11]. In the Bulgarian section of the Danube River and some of its tributaries, other authors reported the parasitic species <i>E. danfordi</i> [2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8]. Its distribution, however, is restricted only to the basins of the rivers Tisa and Timish [12, 13]. Based on recent investigations, including a revision of all collected material from Bulgaria, it has been confirmed that in the Lower Danube, only the species <i>E. mariae</i> has occurred [5].</p>
		<p><b>Negative factors.</b> The main threats are: loss (degradation) of habitats as a result of river regulation by dams and weirs; water pollution.</p>

		<p>Order Falconiformes</p>
		<p>Family Falconidae</p>
		<p><b>Conservation status</b>: <i>in Bulgaria:</i>
			<b>Critically endangered CR</b>=B(1a, 2a)+D, BDA-III; <i>International:</i> CITES-II, BeC-II, BoC-II, ECS-Spec 3, BD.</p>
		<p><b>General distribution.</b> Species of an Ethiopian type of distribution. It breeds in Africa (with the exception of the forest regions and Southern Somalia), the near East, Asia Minor and Southern Europe.</p>
		<p><b>Distribution and abundance in Bulgaria.</b> Resident. There are data about one habitat [1, 2], but the existence of 10 breeding pairs is supposed [3]. The assumption that the species is not found in Bulgaria [2] is based on information available until then [1, 4]. The problem is complicated also by the hybridization of the species with the Saker Falcon (<i>Falco cherrug</i>) [5]. The opportunity to check 1 individual from Stara Zagora was missed [6]. The numbers are unknown. There are 23 reports about the species, 9 of which after 1995 [7]. The latest ones are from Southwestern Bulgaria, to the south of the Dragoman – Svilengrad line, including reports from the Eastern Rhodopes [8] and the Rila mountain (the Rila Monastery Natural Park [9, 10, 11]. Since 1995, 2 inhabited nests have been known, and in 2 other regions there have been observations during the breeding period.</p>
		<p><b>Habitats.</b> Rocky areas in the vicinity of forests, near river valleys as well, but rarely. It also inhabits dry areas, bushy terrains of the Mediterranean type, high mountains (also at altitudes higher than 2 000 m).</p>
		<p><b>Biology.</b> It mainly feeds on small and moderately large birds. It hunts in flight near the ground. At the beginning of March it lays 3 (2-5) eggs. The parents incubate for 32-35 days and feed the young for 35-47 days. They leave the nest at the end of May. In the winter some birds descend to the valleys. Food: mainly birds.</p>
		<p><b>Similar species.</b> The Saker Falcon (<i>Falco cherrug</i>)<i>.</i>
		</p>
		<p><b>Negative factors.</b> Destruction and change of the habitats; disturbance; illegal trade and shooting; hybridization with the Saker Falcon.</p>
		<p><b>Conservation measures taken.</b> The numbers and the distribution have been clarified. One of the major places of finding (in the Eastern Rhodopes) is under yearly monitoring and has been proposed for a national park; all key habitats are included in the network of Important Bird Areas and in the <i>Natura 2000</i> network; the places of the observations in the Rila mountain fall within the national park of the same name.</p>
		<p><b>Conservation measures needed.</b> Development of a National Plan for the conservation of the species; increase of the control against the threats for the species, increase of the state of information and the commitment for its preservation and its habitats among state control bodies in the areas where the species is found; clarification of the breeding status and the peculiarities of breeding, studying the habitats and the threats; working out and implementing a monitoring system; specifying new protected territories; urgent declaration of the Eastern Rhodopes a natural park; placing all the other locations that are critical for the species under a strict protection regime; strict guarding of the nests.</p>

		<p><b>General distribution.</b> A species with a probable Mongolo-Tibetan type of distribution. In Europe, three populations exist: from the Czech Republic through Eastern Austria, Slovakia and Hungary to Serbia and Western Romania, 200 pairs; the Ukraine, including Crimea and Moldova, 340-360 pairs; and a disappearing population near Ural consisting of 30-60 pairs. It is also found in Kazakhstan, Kirgizstan, Uzbekistan, Southern Siberia, Western China and Mongolia.</p>
		<p><b>Distribution and abundance in Bulgaria.</b> Resident and passage migrant, in the past widespread and numerous [1]. Between 20 and 25 years ago and until the middle of the 1990s [2, 3] it was still widespread and, although rather reduced, was even found in Southwestern Bulgaria, which is the natural periphery of the area of the species in the Western Palearctic. At the end of the 20th and the beginning of the 21st century, a catastrophic decline of its numbers was observed [4]. The last successful breeding was registered in 1997, and another one probably took place in 2005. In 2006, in spite of the detailed checks of the breeding habitats from the past in the country, nests were not found (D. Ragyov, personal communication).</p>
		<p><b>Habitats.</b> In Bulgaria, there are two types of habitats: flooded forests and rock complexes in valley and mountainous regions close to open territories. With the decrease of the wetlands it settles more frequently in the mountains. In Europe it gradually moves from the steppe and forest steppe regions to regions with intensive agriculture, where it nests on the poles of power lines.</p>
		<p><b>Biology.</b> The breeding territory is occupied at the end of February. It breeds on rocks and in trees, in nests of other species or directly on a rock cornice, or in niches without any covering. It lays 2 – 6 eggs at the end of March or the beginning of April. The incubation is 30 days, and the young leave the nest at the age of about 40 – 45 days. It mainly feeds on hamsters, which is also the major food for feeding the young. It catches other rodents, as well as small or moderately large birds: doves, crows, thrushes, game birds, etc.</p>
		<p><b>Similar species.</b> The Lanner Falcon (<i>Falco biarmicus</i>)<i>.</i>
		</p>
		<p><b>Negative factors.</b> Taking young birds from the nests and capture of adults during migration and wintering. Decrease of the numbers of the hamster and change of agricultural practices.</p>
		<p><b>Conservation measures taken.</b> A plan for the preservation of the species; two projects for investigation and conservation (a similar project was realized in 2002 – 2004, without finding any breeding); some of the habitats are in protected territories, including national parks.</p>
		<p><b>Conservation measures needed.</b> Guarding nests, in case they are found. Study of the migration and the wintering of the species. Preservation and restoration of the population of the hamster. Ban on falcon artificial breeding. Reintroduction.</p>

		<p><b>General distribution.</b> A species with a Mediterranean type of distribution whose world population is concentrated around the Mediterranean. In Europe there are about 5 900 pairs.</p>
		<p><b>Distribution and abundance in Bulgaria.</b> Registered for the first time in Bulgaria in 1984 [1, 2]. Former possible observations in Atanasovsko Ezero lake [3] were either not taken to be certain [4, 5] or were not published for a long time [6, 7]. Since 1985, the number of the observations have increased considerably, mainly in Southern Bulgaria and the Black Sea coast, less often to the north of the Balkan range (Gabrovo region, June 2004 [8]). Until 2005, there were over 100 observations [9], assuming the very probable breeding of 2-6 pairs along the Black Sea coast, the mountains Eastern Rhodopes [9, 10], Western Rhodopes and the valley of the Struma, and probable breeding in the Eastern Balkan range, the Rila mountain and the valley of the Tundzha [9]. Outside the breeding period, it is mainly found in the regions mentioned above, predominantly along the Black Sea coast and the Eastern Rhodopes (up to about 30 individuals simultaneously). Wandering birds have also been registered in the Western Rhodopes [11], at a highest altitude of 1926 m (Snezhanka peak) [9]. During the winter it has been observed once (near Atanasovsko Ezero lake) [12].</p>
		<p><b>Habitats.</b> Sea shores, outside the breeding period: various rocky regions, mountainous meadows and plateaus.</p>
		<p><b>Biology.</b> With a late multiplication period (from July to September-October). It has been observed along the Black Sea coast hunting domestic doves and hoopoes and eating large insects (Orthoptera) [11, 14, 15, 16].</p>
		<p><b>Similar species.</b> None.</p>
		<p><b>Negative factors.</b> Increased infrastructure development and the increase of tourism at the Black Sea coast.</p>
		<p><b>Conservation measures taken.</b> Protected according to the Biological Diversity Act. The major habitats are in reserves (Kaliakra), Protected Localities (Kozhuh, Oreshari), Important Bird Areas and regions proposed for inclusion in the <i>Natura 2000</i> national ecological network; they are the object of yearly monitoring.</p>
		<p><b>Conservation measures needed.</b> Preparation and implementation of a National Plan for its preservation. Declaring new Protected Territories: the Eastern Rhodopes National Park, etc. Expansion of the existing Protected Territories for the optimization of the survival of the species.</p>

		<p><b>General distribution.</b> A Turkestan-Mediterranean species. It breeds locally in Southern Europe, Northern Africa, Asia Minor and the Near East, Southern Russia, Caucasus, Central Asia in the east to China. In Europe, there are 35 000 – 42 000 pairs.</p>
		<p><b>Distribution and abundance in Bulgaria.</b> A breeding summer visitor and passage migrant. In the past it had numerous colonies, mainly in the towns and villages in Southern Bulgaria. As per 1960, the numbers abruptly diminished and most colonies disappeared [1, 2, 3, 4]. Since 1985 it has been breeding mainly in the Rhodopes, the valley of the Rusenski Lom River, the mountains Eastern Balkans, Sakar and in Southwestern Bulgaria. For 2005, singular pairs are possible, there are no nests known [5, 6]. It migrates in unknown numbers over the whole of the country, after 2000 mainly along the Black Sea coast [3, 4, 5, 7, 8], possibly also in Eastern Bulgaria [9].</p>
		<p><b>Habitats.</b> Rocks and ground walls within the country, in the past also in urban areas and in riverside old trees.</p>
		<p><b>Biology.</b> Colonial, breeding in niches, platforms or cavities in buildings or trees [2]. Since 1985 it has been breeding also singularly, or with several pairs [5]. It arrives in March-April, lays 4-5 eggs in May. The young ones fly away July-August. Migration is from the middle of March to the beginning of May and from the beginning of August to the middle of October [3, 4]. Its food consists of insects and small reptiles.</p>
		<p><b>Similar species.</b> The Common Kestrel (<i>Falco tinnunculus</i>)<i>.</i>
		</p>
		<p><b>Negative factors.</b> Probably the decline of the species in all of its area. The major reasons have to do with changes in breeding and its feeding habitats, and also with threats in the places of wintering in Africa. Potential threats in Bulgaria are turning pastures into arable land, destruction of places appropriate for breeding, direct destruction of the species and also pollution with poisonous substaces in its regions of distribution.</p>
		<p><b>Conservation measures taken.</b> Protected according to the Biological Diversity Act. An international Action Plan has been adopted including Bulgaria. Monitoring of the habitats in the mountains Eastern Rhodopes and Sakar Planina. The regions of finding declared Important Bird Areas [10] and sites belonging to the <i>Natura 2000</i> network [11]. Most of the breeding places are included in protected territories (the Rusenski Lom Natural Park, the reserves Chervenata Stena and Valchi Dol, the Kovankaya Protected Locality) [12]. The declaration of the Eastern Rhodopes as Natural Park has been proposed [12].</p>
		<p><b>Conservation measures needed.</b> Provision of a National Plan for conservation and its implementation; protection measures for the species in the management plans of all protected territories in which it is found. Declaring the Eastern and the Western Rhodopes Natural Parks, development and implementation of plans for their management. Assessment of the opportunities for multiplication in closed space and reintroduction in suitable areas.</p>

		<p><b>General distribution.</b> A cosmopolitan species. It breeds in rocky territories: rarely in human settlements and forest regions in Europe. More frequently observed and numerous in Southern Europe, with the highest numbers in Spain [3].</p>
		<p><b>Distribution and abundance in Bulgaria.</b> Resident. The birds breeding in the height zone (at altitudes of over 1 000 m), perform vertical migrations. In the middle of the 20th century it was extremely rare [1, 7]. Later it was found breeding in separate isolated rocky regions of the country [9], in numbers not higher than 10 pairs [5]. It has not been registered during multiplication in many appropriate areas of Northeastern Bulgaria [2]. For the 1970 – 1991 period, its numbers were 20-25 breeding pairs [12]; other sources point out 30-60 [4], 160-200 [6] and 80-130 [10] pairs. The numbers of the breeding pairs increased from the 1990s to 2006 [2]. At present its numbers amount to about 200 breeding pairs, with a tendency for an increase.</p>
		<p><b>Habitats.</b> Rocky areas – gorges, singular vertical rocks; very rarely in human settlements. It is rare or entirely absent during breeding in the Alpine zone.</p>
		<p><b>Biology.</b> It breeds along rock cornices, niches and platforms of vertical rocks. It also uses old nests of ravens, golden eagles, long-legged buzzards, etc. Although rarely, it also breeds on high buildings in human settlements or in their vicinity [13, personal data]. In the autumn and winter it enters human settlements more frequently while hunting [14]. The courting period starts in March-April. The female ususllay lays 3-4 eggs [13], in most cases directly on the substrate. Incubation continues for 29-30 days. The young ones remain in the nest for about 45 days [1]. Ornithophagous.</p>
		<p><b>Similar species.</b> None.</p>
		<p><b>Negative factors.</b> Collection of eggs and young birds from the nests. Disturbance during breeding. Illegal shooting. Persecution by dove-breeders and farmers.</p>
		<p><b>Conservation measures taken.</b> Protected according to the Biological Diversity Act. Included in the Red Data Book of Bulgaria (1985). About 30% of the breeding habitats are situated in national and natural parks and some reserves.</p>
		<p><b>Conservation measures needed.</b> Imposition of a complete ban on the breeding of predatory birds by private persons and also by organizations for commercial purposes.

The data given are obviously exaggerated, as in 2005 and 2006, in a focused search throughout country, only one breeding pair was found (E. Todorov, personal communication).</p>
		<p><b>Habitats.</b> Open spaces near agricultural areas, field-protecting belts and other forest plantations.</p>
		<p><b>Biology.</b> It breeds colonially from the middle of May in field-protecting belts of Acacia, Ash trees, etc. It uses old nests of Magpies and Rooks. The full clutch consists of 3-4 eggs. The young ones fly away after 26-28 days. It migrates from the end of April and the beginning of May. The autumn migration is during the second half of September to the beginning of October, whereby in Europe it is only over Burgas where real concentrations are observed (up to 3 110 individuals were reported for 1989, with a daily maximum of 1 200 individuals on 20 September 1998) [9]. The food range includes mainly Mole crickets, dragonflies, crickets, beetles, lizards, small mammals [1].</p>
		<p><b>Similar species.</b> The Hobby<i> Falco subbuteo </i>(Linnaeus, 1758).</p>
		<p><b>Negative factors.</b> Use of semi-steppe regions for intensive agricultural production, illegal shooting and wood production in the field-protecting belts.</p>
		<p><b>Conservation measures taken.</b> Protected species since 1962<b>, </b>included in the Red Data Book of Bulgaria (1985) [10]. Intensive studies were carried out on its autumn migration in the region of Burgas Bay [9]. Plans for the management of the reserves Srebarna, Atanasovsko Ezero and Kaliakra, as well as for the lakes Durankulak and Shabla have been prepared and are being implemented. In 2006, the execution of a project for its detailed study was launched.</p>
		<p><b>Conservation measures needed.</b> Study of the factors for the failure of the breeding population in the country; urgent preparation of a National Plan for its preservation; provision of protection for the nests, placing bird houses, increasing the ecological culture of the population.</p>

		<p><b>General distribution.</b> Europe (with a greatly scattered area and without the northern parts), Asia Minor and the Caucasus. The main genetically pure populations are the ones from the Balkans and the Carpatians.</p>
		<p><b>Distribution and abundance in Bulgaria.</b> In all mountains at altitudes of up to about 1 500 – 1 600 m, mosaically in the valleys. Maximum density of 0.84 individuals on 1 000 ha. Numbers according to data until the year 2000, but probably also until today, about 4 000 individuals [1, 2]. Sexually mature individuals: a maximum of 1 800 (~ 1 600 non-hybrid). In the forests and the surrounding agricultural lands at altitudes of up to about 1 000 m about 1 100 individuals; over 1 000 m ~ 500 individuals.</p>
		<p><b>Habitats.</b> It prefers old deciduous forests, also in various biotopes.</p>
		<p><b>Biology.</b> The individual female territories are from 200 to 600 ha, and 600 to over 1 000 ha for the males' territories; the latter may include those of 3 – 6 females. 40% of the females breed only in the second year and give birth to about 3-4 cubs. Basic food: mouse-like rodents, often birds [1, 3]. The Northeastern Bulgarian population shows some genetic differences [4, 5].</p>
		<p><b>Similar species.</b> Differences from the domestic form with a "wild" type of coloration: larger body; a thick top and presence of pale rings on the tail, almost without or with pale continuous stripes on the body, etc. [6]. In biochemical and genetic terms, the European Wildcat shows a well-marked alloenzyme differentiation from the domestic cat in Europe. [7].</p>
		<p><b>Negative factors.</b> Hybridization with feral female domestic cats: probably at least 10 % of the population is represented by phenotypically manifested hybrids [6], in general, hybridisation in Europe is more advanced [8, 9]); the Bulgarian Forestries Questionnaire, 1989, shows the following: in 42 % of the forestries there are no hybrids, in 51 % they are a rarity, in 7 % (outside the mountains in 11 forestries) they are frequent. The Bulgarian population seems to include also phenotypically hidden hybrids [9]. Intensive felling in old forests and modernization in agriculture in the last 50 years; hunting; fragmentation of the local populations; pressure from the jackal and feral dogs in the valleys; road incidents.</p>
		<p><b>Conservation measures taken.</b> A protected species as of 2007. The protected territories are inhabited by about 20% of the breeding animals. Significant populations exist in the Strandzha Natural Park and the Central Balkans National Park.</p>
		<p><b>Conservation measures taken.</b> Declaration of protected territories and zones in the Balkan range, the Rhodopes, the Ludogorie region, Sredna gora, Pirin as well as in the valley refuges of the species [10]. Ban on the use of forests in protected territories and zones and closed forest basins; restriction of felling and reconstruction in old forests and outside them. Planned increase of the area of centuries-old forests [11]. A common plan with Turkey for the preservation of the forest biota in Strandzha. Reduction of the numbers of feral cats and dogs; genetic studies.</p>

		<p><b>General distribution.</b> A species with an European type of distribution. It breeds from Eastern France to Ural and from the Far North to the Mediterranean (an isolated population in Northern Italy); the distribution in the southern periphery of the area is punctate.</p>
		<p><b>Distribution and abundance in Bulgaria.</b> A breeding summer visitor and passage migrant. Before 1985, there were reports about breeding mainly in artificial bird houses in the area of the town of Belogradchik [1]. In the last 10-15 years it has not been found there breeding (Dzhuninski, personal communication). According to our own observations, only 2 breeding places were registered in two of the large city parks of Sofia (Southern Park and Western Park – 1 breeding pair in each in 1987 and 1988, respectively) [2]. There are data of another 4 isolated breeding places [3]. A singing male was reported at the end of May 2001 at an altitude of 500-600 m to the south of the mouth of the Veleka River (S. Dalakchieva and K. Popov, personal communication). During seasonal migrations it is observed in different parts of the country in considerable numbers. It is observed more often during spring migrations. Bulgaria falls within the southern periphery of the breeding area of the species in Southeastern Europe and most probably for this reason its numbers in the different years vary. The breeding population could hardly exceed 20-30 breeding pairs. The tendency of the numbers of the species is towards a decrease.</p>
		<p><b>Habitats.</b> Deciduous forests in the mountains and in the low parts of the country, probably also at higher altitudes, large city parks.</p>
		<p><b>Biology.</b> In Bulgaria it is insufficiently studied. It breeds in old forests and large city parks (with old, or at least moderately old, woody vegetation), but in the latter very rarely, not every year and in singular pairs. It breeds in holes of trees, usually a secondary hole in a tree. It most frequently lays 4-5 eggs. There is one proved breeding cycle, possibly two. The first young ones leave their nests after the period from the beginning to the middle of June. Food: small insects. It hunts both over and beneath the forest canopy.</p>

		<p><b>Negative factors.</b> Loss of habitats – felling mostly old and moderately old beech and mixed deciduous forests in the lower forest belt, probably the global warming.</p>
		<p><b>Conservation measures taken.</b> None.</p>
		<p><b>Conservation measures needed.</b> Conservation of the breeding places of the species known before and after 1985 by banning the deforestation of large areas and the so-called reconstruction of large territories in and around areas with breeding places; a more complete study of the distribution, the biological and ecological peculiarities and of the factors negatively influencing the numbers of the breeding pairs in the country.</p>

		<p><b>Distribution and abundance in Bulgaria.</b> A breeding summer visitor and passage migrant. At the end of the 70s of the 19th century it was found sporadically breeding in Northeastern Bulgaria (probably in the Ludogorie region and/or the Eastern Balkan range) [1], once in Kamchiyski Longoz gorge [2], and in two cases it was observed at the end of May [3; 4]. Since 1975 it has been breeding permanently in the Central Balkan range [5; 6; 7; 8], it also breeds in the Eastern and Western Balkan range [9] and in Strandzha mountain. The total numbers in the country are 700 – 1 000 pairs at an average density of 1 pair/50-100 ha; in the Central Balkan range there are 400-500 pairs.</p>
		<p><b>Biology.</b> Courting songs are registered from the middle of May to the beginning of July. Feeding the young ones is registered during the whole of July, and between 20 July and 10 August groups (families) are often observed; some pairs have a second clutch [5; 6; 8]. The nest is in a hollow in a tree or in a hole in a trunk or branch. The young ones, numbering 5 or 6, fly away on the 13th day [10]. The size of the breeding territories in the Central Balkan range varies, depending on the natural character of the forests, from 7-8 to 25-30 ha. On transects of 1.5 and 6 km, 4 pairs in each have been counted. It feeds on insects. It catches the prey in a short circling flight. It has been observed looking for food also on the ground [5]. Migrations take place in April-May and the end of August-October [3; 11].</p>

		<p><b>General distribution.</b> A European species with a breeding area in almost the whole of Southeastern Europe, Asia Minor and the western parts of Iran [1].</p>
		<p><b>Distribution and abundance in Bulgaria.</b> Because of its classification in the past as a subspecies of the Collared Flycatcher (<i>Ficedula albicollis</i>), it is hard to follow up the development of the population. A possible decline caused by the more intensive felling of older forests, especially in the 1950-1980 period [2, 3]. At present, the numbers are uneven, in most of the habitats tens of pairs/100 km2 breed. The highest (more than 100 pairs/100 km2) numbers are in some riverside forests and in the larger valley and low-mountainous forests. Usually the density decreases with the increase of the altitude. Most of the population is concentrated in the Eastern and the Central Balkan range, the dense forests along the lower reaches of the rivers Batova, Kamchiya and Ropotamo, and in Strandzha mountain. As a total number for the country, some 1 500 – 3 500 pairs breed [2, 3].</p>
		<p><b>Habitats.</b> Mainly old, predominantly natural deciduous forests consisting of raywood ash (<i>Fraxinus oxycarpa</i>)<i>,</i> oak (<i>Quercus </i>spp.)<i>, </i>beech (<i>Fagus silvatica</i>, <i>Fagus orientalis</i>), etc. Comparatively less often, old orchards, woody plantations, town parks and gardens [2, 3].

		<p>Family Gasterosteidae</p>
		<p><b>Conservation status:</b> <i>in Bulgaria</i>: <b>Vulnerable VU</b> [A3]; <i>International:</i> IUCN [LR/lc].</p>
		<p><b>General distribution.</b> It inhabits the northern parts of the Atlantic and the Pacific Oceans: in Europe – from Novaya Zemlya Islands, the White Sea, Kolsk Peninsula and Iceland, to Algeria and the Black Sea; the Baltic Sea; from Greenland to New York; in the Pacific Ocean – from the Bering Strait to Korea and Japan, the Kurile Islands, along the American coast as far south as California.</p>
		<p><b>Distribution and abundance in Bulgaria.</b> In the past, along the entire Black Sea coast, mainly in the limans, the mouths of the rivers and the coastal lakes, as well as the marshes along the Danube [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. It has been recorded in the lakes Varna, Beloslav, Burgas (Vaya) and Mandra [6], and in most Black Sea rivers (3, 4, 7, 8, 9). Recently, the species has been found near Kaliakra [10], in Varna Bay [11], Durankulak Lake [12], the rivers Ropotamo [13], Marinka, Otmanliy, Karaagach, Arapya, Popska, Izgrevsko Dere, Varvara, Butamyata and Silistar [14], as well as in the rivers Kamchiya and Danube [our data]. The presence of the species in the Veleka River has not been confirmed [15].</p>
		<p><b>Habitats.</b> The main habitats of the species are open sea, sea shallows (up to a depth of 6 m, including sea bays), coastal brackish and saline lagoons, permanent rivers and marshes.</p>
		<p><b>Biology.</b> It reaches sexual maturity at the age of 1–2 years. Spawning occurs in April–June at water temperature of 16-24 &deg;C. During the spawning period, males attain a breeding colouration and build nests from plant fragments. The females lay from 500 to 2 000 eggs. The males guard the nests until the eggs hatch. It feeds on crustaceans, worms, insect larvae, fish eggs and small fish [5, 16, 17].</p>
		<p><b>Similar species.</b> The southern ninespine stickleback (<i>Pungitius platygaster</i>). The three-spined stickleback is distinguished by the lower number of dorsal fin spines (2-3), complete row of side bony plates, a well-developed caudal peduncle keel, and higher body length (9-10 cm).</p>
		<p><b>Negative factors.</b> The main threats to the species are the loss of habitats, as a result of draining of marshes and backwaters along the Danube River, as well as the wetlands along the Black Sea coast; tourism and recreation development; water pollution.</p>
		<p><b>Conservation measures taken.</b> The species was listed in the Red Data Book of Bulgaria (1985).</p>

		<p><b>General distribution.</b> A Holarctic species. It breeds in Eurasia and Northern America. In Europe the northern border of the area reaches the Arctic, and the southern one is unclear and passes approximately from Southern France to the Danube and the Northern Black Sea coast. It winters in Central America, Northern and Central Africa and Southern Asia. The total population in Northern Europe is estimated at over 2 million birds [1].</p>
		<p><b>Distribution and abundance in Bulgaria.</b> A breeding summer visitor, passage migrant and winter visitor. At the end of the 19th century it incubated in the Batak Marsh, it was numerous in the regions of Ruse and Sofia (mostly in the Dragoman Swamp); registered during the breeding period near the city of Dobrich and the village of Slaveevo, near the village of Ognyanovo, Pazardzhik region, in the lakes Shabla and Mandrensko [2, 3]. Since 1985 it has been considered extinct as a breeding species in Bulgaria [2]. In May-June 1997 – 1998, certain breeding of 2-3 pairs was registered in the Dragoman Swamp (A. Antonov, D. Atanasova, V. Delov, personal communication). Before 1997 it was not registered there (V. Delov, personal communication). Courtship behaviour of a male was observed in the Tsibarsko Swamp between 11 and 13 June 2004 (A. Antonov, personal communication). In the winter it has low numbers, mainly in Southern Bulgaria and along the Black Sea coast: about 80 individuals at the average with a maximum of 134 in 2001; most wintering birds were found in Atanasovsko Ezero lake – 130 in 1987 [4, 5].</p>

		<p><b>General distribution.</b> A Palearctic species. It breeds in Sweden, Finland, Poland, Northern Ukraine, Russia, Mongolia; It winters in Spain, France, Turkey, Egypt, the countries from Northern Africa, Sudan, Somalia, Northern India, Eastern China.</p>
		<p><b>Distribution and abundance in Bulgaria.</b> At present a passage migrant and rarely winter visitor that at the end of the 19th century bred along the Danubian river bank and in marshes inside the country [1]. Until the first half of the 20th century, in the breeding season it was observed throughout the country – in the districts of Pleven, Dobrich, Varna, the Burgas region, the Sofia region, in the Rhodopes, near Plovdiv, etc. [2]. Its last breeding habitats are the former Batak Marsh and Shabla Lake, where it bred until 1950. During the spring migration it was registered in the regions of Sofia, Dobrich, Pernik [2], Silistra, Haskovo, Kardzhali, Burgas, Varna [1], Pleven [3, 4], Durankulak Lake [5]. During the autumn migration in 1979-1983 between 10 August and 30 October in the region of Burgas Bay, 1 800 birds passed at the average (a maximum number of 4 181 individuals in 1979) [1]. An autumn migration of a flock of 20 individuals was registered in 1993 near Pleven [4]. In the recent years it has been almost extinct as an autumn migrant (T. Michev, personal communication). It wintered regularly in the Pazardzhik region and partly in the Plovdiv region [1]. Its numbers are unknown. In 1887, flocks of 150 individuals were observed, in 1956 – 35-200 individuals. At the beginning of the 20th century, about 30 pairs [2] used to breed. Probably up to 15 individuals irregularly winter [6].</p>
		<p><b>Habitats.</b> Large valleys, in the vicinity of standing water basins, marshes in foothills and mountains, meadows, bogs. During migration on meadows, fallow land, fields, rice-fields, riverside flooded areas, forest meadows etc. Conservative with respect to the places for stationing during migration.</p>
		<p><b>Biology.</b> Ground-nesting, monogamous, migration species. The young ones are nidifugous. In the spring they gather to court with a complex premarital dance. The female lays 2 (1-3) eggs which she incubates for 28-31 days in shifts with the male. The young birds reach their sexual maturity in their 4th – 6th year. Both parents take care of the young. Almost omnivorous.</p>
		<p><b>Similar species.</b> The Demoiselle Crane (<i>Anthropoides virgo</i>).</p>
		<p><b>Negative factors.</b> Destruction and change of habitats, drying up of wetlands, disturbance during breeding and the migration period, illegal hunting, environmental pollution with pesticides.</p>
		<p><b>Conservation measures taken.</b> Some localities used for rest during migration are in protected natural territories. Possibilities are discussed for developing a long-term programme for attracting migrating birds and birds that stop during migration, for the supply of wild individuals from the Ukraine or Russia, breeding them in captivity in closed park-like conditions and for their release initially in flat steppe reserves with the presence of standing water basins.</p>

		<p><b>Distribution and abundance in Bulgaria.</b> At present it is a wandering species that bred in the mountains in the past. At the end of the 19th and the beginning of the 20th century, it was most common in the Balkan Mountains. It has been observed in the western parts of Serbia bordering with Bulgaria, Vitosha, Rila, Pirin, the Rhodopes, Strandzha [1] and the Eastern Balkans [2]. Singular birds were found near the village of Vranino on 20 October1980 and Cape Kaliakra (October 1980) [3], near the village of Potochnitsa on 25 May 2001, over the Kresna Gorge, Belasitsa [4]. There were 5 observations near Madzharovo in 1990-2005 [5]: singular individuals on 21 March 1994, 06 June 1994 and 07 March 1999. Singular individuals also on 25 May 2001 near the village of Studen Kladenets, on 23 January 2001 near the village of Chereshnitsa, 06 May 2001 near the village of Oshtava, 22 August 2004 near Suha Vapa peak in Rila [6]. The numbers in Bulgaria are unknown. Extinct as breeding, probably at the end of the 1950s.</p>
		<p><b>Habitats.</b> Rock massifs in the mountains near large open spaces. Mainly on open mountainous terrains, including the Alpine belt; less frequently in the foothills. It is rare in the valleys, which it visits to look for food.</p>
		<p><b>Biology.</b> Up to 85% of its food are bones of larger mammals. Monogamous. It lays (December – January) 1-2 eggs every 4-5 days, which it incubates for 53-58 days. It breeds one young. The nests are distanced one from the other more than 11 km. It reaches sexual maturity at its 7th year. It starts breeding in its 10-12th year. Food – large birds, hairs, turtles, corpses of large mammals.</p>
		<p><b>Similar species.</b> None.</p>
		<p><b>Negative factors.</b> Disturbance, illegal hunting, a reduced nutrition base, catching in traps, poisoning with baits for birds and mammals of prey and rodents poisoned by pesticides which it sometimes eats, reduction of the nutrition base, late sexual maturity, low breeding capacity.</p>
		<p><b>Conservation measures taken.</b> Some of the potential places for habitation are included in protected natural territories. The development of a long-term programme is envisaged for the supply of individuals from Greece, Turkey or Southwestern Russia (Eastern Caucasus) and releasing captive bred birds in mountainous reserves in or the vicinity of large rock massifs and the presence of large wild and domestic ungulates; creation of large buffer zones near the reserves; non-use of non-selective poisonous traps and pesticides and other chemicals near the sites for re-introduction; artificial feeding in appropriate places; organization of international protected natural territories (for example with Macedonia, Serbia, Greece, Turkey) in which the species is still found or which it inhabited until recently.</p>

		<p><b>Distribution and abundance in Bulgaria.</b> Resident, in the past numerous on rocky sites [1, 2, 3]. It disappeared at the middle of the 20th century, after 1970 it returned to the Eastern Rhodopes along the Arda River between the city of Kardzhali and the villages of Madzharovo: 1 breeding pair in 1978 [1], until 1985 there were 1-4 nests [4, 5]. [6], in 2005 there were 36 nests [7]. It wanders in Southern Bulgaria [3, 5] and migrates along the Black Sea coast (3-5 individuals) [5] and the Sofia field [8].</p>
		<p><b>Habitats.</b> Rocky regions in the valleys of large rivers, often in the presence of wolves.</p>
		<p><b>Biology.</b> It breeds colonially (up to 10-12 pairs) in large rock complexes, periodically changing the breeding places. Singular nests are known as well (including near roads) [6]. It lays in January 1 egg. Carrion-eating, depending on freely grazing domestic animals and on the veterinary-sanitary servicing. Tens of birds may gather at one site for feeding.</p>
		<p><b>Similar species.</b> The Eurasian Black Vulture (<i>Aegypius monachus</i>).</p>
		<p><b>Negative factors.</b> Poisoning, illegal shooting, lack of food, clashes with electricity lines [5]. Most significant are the decrease of cattle (especially after 1985-1989), placing poisonous baits and the worsening of the habitats as a result of mining activities, forestation, disturbance, etc.). Since 2004, 40 wind turbines have become a threat in Greece near the Bulgarian border, in a region where the birds pass.</p>
		<p><b>Conservation measures taken.</b> Protected according to the Biological Diversity Act. Included in the Red Data Book of Bulgaria (1985). National and international legal measures have been adopted, a programme for maintaining and restoration activities, monitoring and stimulation of traditional animal breeding [9]. The breeding habitats are declared Protected Territories, Important Bird Areas [10] and <i>Natura 2000</i> protected zones [11, 12].

		<p><b>General distribution.</b> Europe, the Danube River basin.</p>
		<p><b>Distribution and abundance in Bulgaria.</b> In the past, the species was recorded in the Danube River (from Vidin to Silistra), and the Iskar River (near the village of Dolni Lukovit) [1, 2, 3, 4], as well as in the Golyama Kamchiya River (near the village of Ivanski) [5]. Later, it was found in the Danube River and the mouths of its tributaries Vidbol, Lom, Ogosta, Iskar (rarely), Vit, Osam and Yantra (single specimens reached as far upstream as the village of Polsko Kosovo) [6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11]. In the period 2005-2006, single specimens were found in the Danube River along the entire stretch between the village of Vrav and the village of Vetren, but the species was not recorded in the Danube tributaries and in the Kamchiya River basin [our data].</p>
		<p><b>Habitats.</b> It is found in permanent large rivers.</p>
		<p><b>Biology.</b> It inhabits the deep sections of the rivers, with sandy and gravel bottom. It reaches sexual maturity in the second year, rarely, in the first year. Spawning occurs at water temperature of 8-14&deg;C, in the period March-May. The fecundity of females ranges from 18 900 to 45 400 eggs. It is active during the night, when it moves to shallow places to feed. It feeds on crustaceans, worms, insect larvae and fish eggs. It reaches a maximum body length of 300 mm and a maximum weight of 250 g. The life span is 7 years. [11, 12, 13].</p>
		<p><b>Similar species.</b> The ruffe <b>(</b> <i>Gymnocephalus cernuus</i>) and the Danube ruffe (<i>G. baloni</i>). The Schraetzer is distinguished by the elongated body with lower depth and by the presence of 3-4 dark longitudinal stripes on both sides.</p>

		<p><b>General distribution.</b> A Palearctic species with a scattered breeding area in Europe and Asia.</p>
		<p><b>Distribution and abundance in Bulgaria.</b> Resident, with wintering of young birds mainly in the more northern regions (the Danube Delta). In the past, it often bred near the Danube, the Black Sea coast and the valleys of the large rivers. In the second half of the previous century, the number of breeding pairs abruptly diminished. In the 1980s, only 1 pair bred on Belene Island [1, 2]. Later the breeding population was estimated at 2-6 pairs [3]. Since the beginning of the 1990s, a slow restoration of the population has been observed, mostly along the Danube (at present at least 12 pairs, 6 of which on Bulgarian territory). Along the Black Sea coast, there are only 3 pairs for now. A novelty is the staying of a pair within the country, near Ivaylovgrad Reservoir. The total number of breeding and potentially breeding pairs is 11 [4]. In the winter, the numbers increase at the expense of wandering and settling young birds, mainly from the delta of the Danube; these fluctuate probably between 30 and 40 individuals. In January 2005, along the Danube between the town of Somovit and the city of Silistra, 25 birds were registered [4].</p>
		<p><b>Habitats.</b> Coasts of seas, rivers and lakes rich in fish and water birds, with trees that are high and comfortable for nesting. In the winter also in places around artificial water basins – reservoirs, fish farms, etc.</p>
		<p><b>Biology.</b> The pair has several nests built mainly on white poplar trees, that it changes during the separate years. In March, the female lays 1-3 eggs. Incubation continues for 38-42 days. The young ones remain in the nest for 80-90 days. It feeds on fish, water birds, small mammals, etc. [2].</p>
		<p><b>Similar species.</b> None.</p>
		<p><b>Negative factors.</b> In the past, direct persecution and killing; placing poisonous baits for predatory mammals; felling trees along the Danube islands, continuing to the present day.</p>
		<p><b>Conservation measures taken.</b> Protected according to the Biological Diversity Act. Included in the Red Data Book of Bulgaria (1985). Some of the breeding places are in the reserves Kamchiya and Ropotamo and in Belene Natural Park.</p>
		<p><b>Conservation measures needed.</b> Change in the forestry practice on the islands and the shores of the Danube, as felling large white poplar trees is a significant factor for the preservation of the species.</p>

		<p><b>Conservation status:</b> <i>in Bulgaria:</i>
			<b>Critically endangered CR</b>=[B1a+2 a + c (iii) + C2 a], BDA-III;<i> International: </i>BeC-III.</p>
		<p><b>General distribution.</b> A cosmopolitan species. It mainly breeds along the seashores of Europe and Eastern Asia and along the internal continental water basins of Eastern Europe and Western Asia. A migratory bird for Europe and the northern parts of the Asian area. In the more southern regions it is found all the year round. The European population consists of over 300 thousand breeding pairs [1].</p>
		<p><b>Distribution and abundance in Bulgaria.</b> A breeding summer visitor, passage migrant and rarely wintering species. From the end of the 19th to the middle of the 20th century, it was registered as a passing, wandering or summering species along the Black Sea coast [2, 3, 4] and the valleys of the rivers Maritsa and Danube [5, 6, 7, 8]. The first certain breeding was reported on an island in the Maritsa River near the village of Orizare, Plovdiv region, in 1973 [9], and several years later it was found breeding in Atanasovsko Ezero lake [10]. In 1991 it was found breeding also on Tsibar Island [11]. Until the beginning of the 1990s, the population was estimated at 40 – 70 pairs [11, 12]. For the period from 1995 to 2005, the data from field studies show some reduction of the numbers: the Maritsa River, 28 pairs (T. Petrov, M. Marinov, D. Todorov, personal communication); Atanasovsko Ezero lake, 1-3 pairs, the Poda locality, 1 pair [13]; the Danube, on an unnamed island on the Danube, 2-3 pairs [14]. During the recent studies of the population along the Maritsa River from the village of Ognyanovo, Pazardzhik region, to the state border in June 2006, a total of 9 pairs and 9 singular individuals were registered (T. Petrov, M. Velev, M. Petrov, personal communication). In the second half of July, along the Black Sea coast, migrating individuals or small groups fly in. Singular Eurasian Oystercatchers very rarely stay to winter in Bulgaria [13]. The total numbers of the population are 30-50 breeding pairs.</p>
		<p><b>Habitats.</b> It breeds on sandy and gravelly river islands amongst flowing waters, dikes of salt pits and rice fields, meadows near fish farms, etc.</p>
		<p><b>Biology.</b> Formed pairs and protection of breeding territories are observed at the end of March. It does not form colonies but along the Black Sea coast it breeds close to other Charadriiformes and probably also in their colonies [13]. Laying eggs takes place from the beginning of April to the middle of May. Because of a flooding of the first clutch, the pair may resort to a second breeding [9]. Food: small crustaceans, mussels, larvae of insects, rarely small fish.</p>
		<p><b>Similar species.</b> None.</p>
		<p><b>Negative factors.</b> Flooding the islands with nests along the Maritsa River and the Danube by high waters; disturbance during incubation, killing the young by stray dogs and cats, predators, etc.</p>
		<p><b>Conservation measures taken.</b> A protected species since 1962, included in the Red Data Book of Bulgaria (1985) as endangered. The breeding habitats in the lakes Atanasovsko and Poda fall within protected natural territories.</p>

		<p><b>General distribution.</b> An Eastern Mediterranean species breeding in the western and southern seaside regions of Turkey, Greece (including many islands), Bulgaria, Macedonia, Albania, Croatia and Montenegro [1, 2]. It mainly winters in Eastern and Southern Africa.</p>
		<p><b>Distribution and abundance in Bulgaria.</b> The first reports about the species were for the region of the town of Sliven (1875) and much later for the village of Gyulovtsa, Burgas region [3]. In the last 40 years the species was found breeding in all the regions with significant Mediterranean biotic impact: the valley of the river Struma (from the Kresna gorge to the south) and the Sandanski-Petrich field; the valley of the river Mesta (from the town of Momina Klisura to the south); and the Rhodopi range (the valleys of the rivers Arda, to the east of the town of Kardzhali, Krumovitsa and Byala Reka); the Sakar mountain, the Tundzha hills, the Derventski hills, Strandzha and the Black Sea coast [4, 5, 6, 7, 8]. The territory of distribution is about 6000 km<sup>2</sup>. The population is fragmented and many habitats have several pairs each. Abundance 950 – 1 100 breeding pairs on 1 200 – 1 400 km<sup>2</sup> habitats possible for the species at an average density of 0,8 pairs/1 km<sup>2</sup>. The average maximum density for the country is 1,6 pairs/1 km<sup>2</sup> (1). There are estimates close to the maximum but with much lower minimal (100 – 500 pairs) abundance [2, 9, 10]. Other estimates give much higher values – up to 3 500 pairs [9, 11].</p>
		<p><b>Biology.</b> Passage migrant. The nest is usually built in shrubs and junipers. The incubation of the eggs (3-4) in Southwestern Bulgaria starts at the beginning of May [4, 5, 6]. Sometimes the pair has 2 clutches (P. Simeonov, unpublished information).</p>
		<p><b>Habitats.</b> Dry stony slopes, valleys and gorges with bush vegetation and light low forests of the Mediterranean type in the hilly and the pre-mountain belt and along the sea shore.</p>
		<p><b>Negative factors.</b> Destruction and change of habitats (construction on the sea shore and disturbance by tourism, clearing terrains for agriculture, fires, felling); the restricted area and the low abundance of the world population (a minimum of 11 000 pairs) presuppose significant fluctuations in the numbers of the species.</p>
		<p><b>Conservation measures taken.</b> The species is protected and many of its habitats fall within Protected Territories and sites of the <i>Natura 2000</i> network.</p>
		<p><b>Conservation measures needed.</b> Carrying out investigations on the biology and the ecology of the species and monitoring of its state. Declaration of Protected Zones and Territories.</p>

		<p><b>General distribution.</b> A Turkestan-Mediterranean species distributed in Europe. SW and Central Asia, Northern Africa, New Guinea and Australia. It winters in Africa and India, Ceylon and Burma. In the southern parts of the area it is resident and in the northern ones it is migratory.</p>
		<p><b>Distribution and abundance in Bulgaria.</b> A breeding summer visitor and passage migrant. At the end of the 19th century it was ubiquitously distributed [1], but not very frequent [2]. Gradually its numbers decreased to about 100 breeding pairs [3].At present it is distributed throughout the country, but with a low density: mainly in the Balkan range and the area in front of the Balkan range, the mountains Sredna Gora, Eastern Rhodopes, Strandzha, Sakar, in Dobrudzha and the Ludogorie region. It is more numerous in Eastern Bulgaria [4]. In the Danube valley and the Thracian lowland it is rarer [4]. The breeding population is between 150 and 200 pairs [5]. The numbers are stable, probably with a slight decrease because of the mass felling of old forests in Bulgaria in the last 10 years. During migration it is often found, especially along the Black Sea coast.</p>
		<p><b>Habitats.</b> Old deciduous forests in the semi-mountainous and hilly regions at altitudes of up to 2 000 m and the low parts of the higher mountains.</p>
		<p><b>Biology.</b> The pairs occupy the breeding territory at the end of March and the beginning of April. The courting flight is a characteristic wave-like diving. The nest is located in old deciduous or mixed forests, it rarely breeds on rocks. It lays 2 eggs. Incubation continues for 36 – 39 days, the young ones staying in the nest for about 50 days. It feeds on hamsters and other rodents, birds (doves, thrushes, larks, titmice), reptiles, etc. that it catches in forests and open spaces.</p>

		<h1>Beluga</h1>
		<p><b><i>Huso huso</i> (Linnaeus, 1758)</b></p>
		<p>Order Acipenseriformes</p>
		<p>Family Acipenseridae</p>
		<p><b>Conservation status:</b> <i>in Bulgaria</i>: <b>Critically endangered CR </b>[A1ad], BDA-II, IV;<i> International:</i> IUCN [EN A2d], BeC-II, III, CITES-II.</p>
		<p><b>General distribution.</b> The Black Sea, the Sea of Azov, the Caspian Sea and the Adriatic Sea, as well as the adjacent rivers. In the Adriatic region, the finding of single specimens near Venice, in the lower and middle reaches of the Po River, and rarely, along the Albanian coast have been reported. In the Black Sea region, the beluga enters the large rivers, such as: the Danube, Dnieper, Southern Bug and Dniester, for spawning. In the Danube River, the species enters its tributaries Morava, Drava, Sava, Tisa, etc.</p>
		<p><b>Distribution and abundance in Bulgaria.</b> In the past, it was a comparatively rare species along the entire Bulgarian Black Sea coast and the Bulgarian section of the Danube River [1, 2, 3]. Recently, its population has declined sharply and only single specimens have been caught [4].</p>
		<p><b>Habitats.</b> In different periods of the year it is found in different habitats. During the reproduction period, it inhabits permanent large rivers, and during the rest of the period – open sea, coastal areas and estuaries.</p>
		<p><b>Biology.</b> The males reach sexual maturity at the age of 10-13 years, and females at 13-15 years [5]. Spawning lasts from February through May at water temperature of 4–11°C [6]. Eggs are laid in deep water with strong current and sandy and gravel bottom [1]. The fecundity ranges between 267 000 and 924 000 eggs [5]. The juveniles feed on insect larvae and the adults – on mollusks, crustaceans and fish [4, 7].</p>
		<p><b>Similar species.</b> In the Bulgarian section of the river Danube and the Black Sea, another 5 species of sturgeons have been found: the Russian sturgeon (<i>Acipenser gueldenstaedtii</i>), the ship sturgeon (<i>A. nudiventris</i>), the sterlet (<i>A. ruthenus</i>), the starry sturgeon (<i>A. stellatus</i>) and the common sturgeon (<i>A. sturio</i>). The beluga is distinguished by its large crescent-shaped mouth and gill membranes broadly connected with each other.</p>
		<p><b>Negative factors.</b> Loss (degradation) of spawning grounds, as a result of river regulation by dams and weirs; water pollution; poaching and overfishing.</p>
		<p><b>Conservation measures taken.</b> The species was included in Annexes II and IV of the Biological Diversity Act (2002). An Action Plan for the Conservation of Sturgeons in Bulgaria has been adopted (Ministry of Environment and Water, 2004). A temporary ban on catch of sturgeons in the Black Sea was initiated (Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, 2006).</p>
		<p><b>Conservation measures needed.</b> Imposition of a total moratorium on sturgeon fishery in the Danube River and the Black Sea. Reintroduction of the species into the Danube River.</p>

It is found almost throughout the country, at altitudes under 600 m [1, 2], and in some mountains (the Balkan range, Sredna Gora, Lozenska Planina) [1]. Wintering birds have been registered near the city of Plovdiv, Beloslav Lake, the village of Strumsko, Blagoevgrad region [1] and the village of Tyulenovo, Dobrich region [2]. At present its breeding distribution mainly embraces the Danube valley and the Black Sea coast and is less frequently within the country. The numbers are estimated at 1 000 [1], 200-2000 [3], even 5 000 [4] breeding pairs. The highest concentration of breeding habitats are in the Danube valley, the Thracian, Tundzha and Burgas lowlands and in the Sofia field.</p>
		<p><b>Habitats.</b> Mainly freshwater basins in the low parts of the country. It prefers vast reedbeds and bushes in freshwater marshes and flooded areas and in the lower reaches of large rivers [5]. Outside the breeding season it is also found in habitats that are non-typical of the species, such as deserted terrains and the environs of forests in the low parts of the mountains.</p>
		<p><b>Biology.</b> It inhabits standing overgrown water basins. It lays 2-9 eggs that it incubates for 16-21 days. It has 1-3 generations yearly. It feeds on insects, spiders, mollusks, crustaceans, small fish and small amphibians and their larvae.</p>

During the multiplication period it has been registered in other parts of the Black Sea coast as well, and also near the town of Svishtov, the city of Sofia, the village of Zagortsi, Burgas region [10]. In the 1990s, its numbers in Atanasovsko Ezero lake were up to 62 pairs [11, 12]. Since 1997, there have been no data of breeding in Bulgaria. Two unsuccessful attempts at breeding were reported for Pomoriysko Ezero lake [12]. Larger concentrations during the autumn migration have been observed near cape Kaliakra [13] and the Burgas lakes [12, 14]. The population wintering in Bulgaria is small, concentrated mainly along the Black Sea coast [15].</p>

		<p><b>Conservation status:</b> <i>in Bulgaria:</i>
			<b>Vulnerable VU</b> C, BDA-III; <i>International:</i> ECS-Spec 2, BD-I, BeC-III.</p>
		<p><b>General distribution.</b> A Mediterranean species breeding on the Balkan peninsula; Cyprus, Asia Minor, the Near East and the Middle East to Turkmenistan and probably Afganistan.</p>
		<p><b>Distribution and abundance in Bulgaria.</b> A breeding summer visitor. After the first registering in 1963, comparatively few observations followed in the southernmost parts of the country, mainly in Southwestern Bulgaria [1, 2]. At present, it is mainly found in Southern Bulgaria [1, 2, 3]. It breeds along the lower reaches of the Struma and the low parts of the surrounding mountains. In the Upper Thracian lowland it is well represented along the Maritsa River and some of its tributaries, at places in the northern low mountainous regions of the Rhodopes and Sakar. It has a scattered distribution in the mountains Eastern Rhodopes, Western Strandzha, in the north to Sredna Gora. Along the Black Sea coast it is rare, in the north it reaches the region of cape Emine. It is incidentally reported to the north of the Balkan range. The supposed numbers in the country are 1 800 – 2 200 pairs [3].</p>
		<p><b>Habitats.</b> Pseudomaquises [1]; thinned xerothermic oak forests of the sub-Mediterranean type (mostly Eastern white oak) [3]; riverside cultures of hybrid poplar, less often overgrowths of willow, ash-tree and acacia [3, 5]; orchards, plantations of walnut-trees, almond-trees, town parks (Kenana in the city of Haskovo) [D. Dermendzhiev and S. Stoychev, unpublished data]. Settling in forest cultures that appeared in the place of natural plantations is an adaptation of the species with a potentially long-term nature-conservation significance [5].</p>
		<p><b>Biology.</b> A monogamous, territorial species. In appropriate habitats it forms thin concentrations: up to 6 pairs/1.9 ha in riverside poplar culture. The nest is small and well-masked, located at a height between 0,95 and 18 m over the ground [3, 5]. The clutches most often contain 4-6 eggs. Only the female incubates, for about 14-16 days. The food of the species basically consists of insects. Food "reserves" in Bulgaria have been registered at the end of the summer [3, 4].</p>
		<p><b>Similar species.</b> None.</p>
		<p><b>Negative factors.</b> Change and degradation of the habitats: wood production, fires, etc. Forestry activities have a potentially negative influence related to the use of chemicals and disturbance during the breeding period.</p>
		<p><b>Conservation measures taken.</b> Protected according to the Biological Diversity Act. Some of the habitats of the species fall within different Protected Territories – Reserves, Protected Localities, Important Bird Areas.</p>
		<p><b>Conservation measures needed.</b> Carrying out forestry activities outside the breeding period. Making targeted investigations of the species. Declaration of new Protected Territories: some of the habitats will fall within the Eastern Rhodopes Natural Park, within some Important Bird Areas, etc.</p>

		<p><b>General distribution.</b> A trans-Palearctic species whose breeding area embraces Newfoundland island, Greenland, Iceland, the Faroe Islands and the British Isles, the Scandinavian peninsula, Western and Central Europe, Spain, Italy, the former Yugoslavia, Bulgaria, Romania, Russia, Mongolia and China. The southern border of its breeding area passes through the territory of Bulgaria. Since 1987 it has also been breeding in Northern Greece. It winters in the western part of the Atlantic Ocean, around the Mediterranean and the Black Sea, the southern and the eastern shores of Asia, Africa and America.</p>
		<p><b>Distribution and abundance in Bulgaria.</b> A breeding summer visitor and wintering species, in the past it incubated in the Svishtov Swamp [1]. There were episodic breeding habitats in Atanasovsko Ezero lake and near the village of Chernomorets, Burgas region [2]. In 1963, a breeding colony of 120 pairs was found in Garvansko Marsh [3]. In the second half of the 20th century it bred only on Persina Island and in Srebarna Lake [4], where there was a colony with large numbers: between 300 and 500 pairs [3], between 5 and 40 pairs in 2001-2003 [5]. In both breeding habitats the numbers vary greatly during the years [6]. The breeding population in the country is estimated at 500-700 [7], 250-350 [8], 180-250 [9], but in recent years it has not exceeded 300 pairs. During migrations and wintering it is one of the most frequently observed and numerous species of gulls in the low parts of the country.</p>
		<p><b>Habitats.</b> Marshes and lakes with ample water vegetation. Outside the multiplication period: fish farms, reservoirs, canals, dumping grounds.</p>
		<p><b>Biology.</b> It breeds in independent or mixed colonies situated on floating root systems of reed, leaves of water lilies (Srebarna Lake, Garvansko Marsh) and sticking from the water stumps (Persina island). It lays 1-3 eggs. The young ones hatch at the end of May and the beginning of June. After the end of the breeding period, the young and adult birds wander in large flocks. They eat fish, shrimps, insects [3].</p>
		<p><b>Similar species.</b> The Mediterranean Gull (<i>Larus melanocephalus</i>).</p>
		<p><b>Negative factors.</b> Unknown. Most probably changes of the natural water regime in the traditional breeding habitats (Persina Island, Garvansko Marsh, Srebarna Lake).</p>

		<p><b>General distribution.</b> The fresh water basins of Central and Eastern Europe from France eastward to the Volga River basin. In the north, it reaches Southern Sweden. It is introduced to Great Britain.</p>
		<p><b>Distribution and abundance in Bulgaria.</b> In the past, the species was found only in the Dyavolska River [1]. For a long time, it was not recorded anywhere and it was considered absent in Bulgaria [2]. Later, it was found in Beloslav Lake [3], in marshes and canals of the Provadiyska River [4] and in the mouth of the Devnya River [5]. It was also found in the Kamchiya River basin, near the mouth, and in the region of the Krusha fish ponds [6], as well as in the Danube River [7]. Gradually, the species disappeared in most of its previous habitats. In Beloslav Lake it was reported as very rare as early as the 1960s [8], and at present it is no longer found there. The occurrence of the species in the Black Sea rivers needs confirmation. In 2005-2006, it was found only in the Danube (near the villages of Novo Selo, Gomotartsi, Koshava, Simeonovo, Archar and Stanevo) and the adjacent wetlands, such as the Orsoya fish ponds [our data].</p>
		<p><b>Habitats.</b> The lower reaches of permanent rivers and coastal fresh water lakes. It inhabits calm waters overgrown with vascular aquatic plants.</p>
		<p><b>Biology.</b> A shoaling fish. It reaches sexual maturity in the second year. Spawning takes place in shallow waters, among abundant aquatic vegetation, in the period from April to June. The females lay the eggs in strings wound spirally around plant stems with the help of elongated urogenital papillae. The fecundity of females ranges from 80 to 2 300 eggs. It feeds on phytoplankton and zooplankton, reaching a maximum body length of 9-12 cm. It has a life span of about 5 years [9, 10].</p>
		<p><b>Similar species.</b> It greatly resembles the young bleak (<i>Alburnus alburnus</i>), from which it can be differentiated by the absent or incomplete lateral line with 1-12 scales anteriorly.</p>
		<p><b>Negative factors.</b> Changes in the hydrological regime and pollution of the coastal lakes and the Black Sea rivers, as well as the pollution of the Danube River which resulted in a loss of the species habitats. A negative factor is also the competition of non-indigenous fish species.</p>
		<p><b>Conservation measures taken.</b> The species was listed in the Red Data Book of Bulgaria (1985).</p>

		<p><b>Distribution and abundance in Bulgaria.</b> Distributed along the Black Sea coast: Shablenska Tuzla Lake (unpublished data), to the north of Pomorie [1, 2] between 1970 and 1995, the Poda Protected Area to the south of Burgas (unpublished data). Locally abundant in the habitats typical of the species. Outside the Black Sea coast, it was found in Trevistoto Lake of the group of Smolyan lakes: one male accidentally got into this water body.</p>
		<p><b>Habitats.</b> Shore stagnant brackish water bodies(saltiness of the water up to 13-14 ‰), with presence of <i>Bolboschoenus maritimus</i>.</p>
		<p><b>Biology.</b> The nymphs inhabit the underwater part of the plants in temporary water bodies. For emergence, the stems of <i>Bolboschoenus maritimus</i> or the reed (<i>Phragmites australis</i>) are selected. Important for the survival of the adults are the densely situated reed stems in the peripheral part of the water body or the stems distanced up to 30 m. They are chosen as places for sexual maturing. Mating couples perch on plants over the water basin in lit sections or in more densely overgrown places. The female always lays accompanied by the male, placing the eggs in the tissue of <i>B. maritimus</i>. Usually when laying eggs the water bodies are dry.</p>
		<p><b>Negative factors.</b> Change of the habitats of the species. The development of <i>Bolboschoenus maritimus</i> leads to the creation of more dense overgrowth. Usually these sections are occupied by <i>Lestes dryas</i> that substitutes <i>L. macrostigma</i> in such changes.</p>

		<p>Order Gadiformes</p>
		<p>Family Gadidae</p>
		<p><b>Conservation status:</b> <i>in Bulgaria</i>: <b>Vulnerable VU</b> [A1b, d; B1b, c].</p>
		<p><b>General distribution.</b> The northern parts of Europe, Asia and North America.</p>
		<p><b>Distribution and abundance in Bulgaria.</b> In the past, it was very abundant in the Danube River, and it was found in its tributaries: the Iskar River (as far upstream as Mezdra and Roman, rarely even reaching Vrazhdebna), and the Yantra River (near the village of Dolna Studena, and its tributary the Rositsa River) [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. Later, the species was recorded in the Danube River, the Iskar River (rare, reaching upstream Cherven Bryag) and the mouth of the Yantra River [6, 7, 8, 9, 10]. At present, it is found only in the Danube [our data]. In the period from 2002 to 2005, its annual catch decreased 7-fold [11].</p>
		<p><b>Habitats.</b> It is found in permanent large rivers with slow current and in deep lakes.</p>
		<p><b>Biology.</b> Cold water and nocturnal species. In the summer, it is slightly active, and during the day it hides in deep holes, under rocks, among roots of trees and dense aquatic vegetation. During the night, it moves to shallow areas to feed. Depending on the geographical region that it inhabits, the species reaches sexual maturity between the first and eighth year. Spawning occurs in winter (December-March) at water temperature of about 0°C. The fecundity of females ranges from 100 000 to 3 000 000 eggs. The juveniles feed on crustaceans, insect larvae and mollusks, while the adults feed mainly on fish. It attains a maximum length of 150 cm and a maximum weight of 34 kg. The maximum age reached is 20 years, but usually the life span is 10-12 years [12, 13].</p>

		<p><b>General distribution.</b> The largest part of Eurasia, Atlas.</p>
		<p><b>Distribution and abundance in Bulgaria.</b> Until the 1930s it was present almost throughout the country, numbering 4 000 – 5 000 individuals [1], however, in the 1950s it declined significantly and become a threatened species [2]. In the 1970-1990 period its numbers increased again: 800 – 1 400 individuals [3; 4]. It is found in the valleys, along the sea coast and in the mountains at altitudes of up to 600 m in 54% of the water catchments; 600 – 1 100 m in 27%; 1100-1500 m – in 19% (in the Western Rhodopes). Calculated numbers as per 2007 (without the cubs): about 1 300 – 1 500 individuals, at an average length of the individual river territory 5-15 km and 2-5 km of the coastal sections of closed water basins and the Black Sea; 800 – 1 000 breeding individuals. The higher population density is in Southeastern Bulgaria [3; 4; 5; 6; Questionnaire, G. Spiridonov, L. Mileva 1989; N. Spassov, V. Ivanov, unpubl. information].</p>
		<p><b>Habitats.</b> Natural river currents and closed water basins with a length of at least 15-20 km: with overgrown shores – dense tree and shrub vegetation, alder-groves and reed (low shores), various fish fauna with a minimum mass of 40 kg/ha, abundance of crayfish, frogs, vertebrates, mollusks [5; 7; 8; N. Spassov, V. Ivanov, unpubl. information].</p>
		<p><b>Biology.</b> The individual territory of the male may overlap that of 1 or more females [4; 7; 9; 10]. The dens are in the roots of shore trees. The cubs (2-4) are born in March – August [Questionnaire, 1989] and follow their mother for 1 year. In Southeastern Bulgaria fish is up to 93% of the prey (an average of 62% spring-summer and 74% autumn-winter); accessory food: crustaceans (14, respectively 7,5%, in an abundance up to 51%), frogs (11, 6%, and up to 23%), mammals, birds, reptiles [10; N. Spassov, V. Ivanov, unpublished information]. It catches its prey at a depth of up to 4 m [7].</p>
		<p><b>Negative factors.</b> Dikes and correction of riverbeds; pollution of the waters; reduction of the quantity of fish; drying up marshes; clearing the tree and shrub shore vegetation; water construction; ballast quarries; human poaching (53% of the losses, mainly near microdams and fisheries) [11]; accidents with road vehicles; catching in fishing nets; victims of wandering dogs; disturbance; winter-autumn drying of rivers (up to 105 days; ice phenomena in Northern Bulgaria and in the mountains over 1 500 m.</p>

		<p><i>Lynx pardinus</i>: Christovich, 1884: p. 30; <i>Felis lynx</i> L.: Popov, 1933: p. 295.</p>
		<p>Order Carnivora</p>
		<p>Family Felidae</p>
		<p><b>Conservation status:</b> <i>in Bulgaria</i>: <b>Critically endangered CR </b>[D+E], BDA-II, III; <i>International:</i> BeC-III, HD-II, IV.</p>
		<p><b>General distribution.</b> The Palearctic: including Northern and Eastern Europe, Central Europe mainly in the Carpathian Mountains; in the Alps and the neighbouring regions it was successfully restored after 1967 (Slovenia, 1973) and/or settled by itself. The endangered autochthonous Balkan population inhabits Southwestern Serbia, Montenegro, Macedonia, Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina and possibly Strandzha (Bulgaria and Turkey).</p>
		<p><b>Distribution and abundance in Bulgaria.</b> It was assumed to be extinct at the beginning of the 40s of the previous century [1]. After 1985, reports of its appearance became more frequent for the Central Balkan range, Rila, the Western Rhodopes (Dobrostan and Dabrash), the valley of the river Danube and the Ludogorie region, the river Ropotamo [ 2], Strandzha [3], the Western border mountains [4]. Observed (2000) to the south of the village of Stakevtsi, the Western Balkan range (E. Dzhuninski, personal communication); in the same region its presence was proved in 2004/5 [2]. Obviously, these lynxes are part of the population that formed in the last 20-25 years in Eastern Serbia [5] by animals that settled on their own from the Carpathian Mountains, numbering about 30 individuals [2, 6, 7].</p>
		<p><b>Habitats.</b> Spacious forest massifs in the mountains. It prefers old natural forests and rocky places; it also hunts in the sub-alpine and the Alpine zone.</p>
		<p><b>Biology.</b> The mating season is in February-March. The cubs, most frequently 2-3, are born in May-June. In the search for hunting territory and a partner, the young animals, as well as the adult ones from local populations with low density or in conditions of lack of food, can be found in non-typical places, making distant trips. Expected individual territory in Bulgarian conditions: 3000 – 10 000 ha. The basic prey consists of roe-deer, young wild boars, hares; the food range also includes female and young deers, galiform birds, rodents [8, 9]. It also attacks farm animals. The wolf is the major competitor and enemy.</p>
		<p><b>Similar species.</b> None.</p>
		<p><b>Negative factors.</b> Illegal shooting, decrease of wild ungulates, felling old forests and fragmentation of their massifs, road accidents. Hybridization of the autochthonous relict population with the increasing population of Carpathian lynxes in the northern part of former Yugoslavia.</p>
		<p><b>Conservation measures taken.</b> Included in the Red Book of Bulgaria, 1985, as an extinct species. A proposal for reintroduction [10] and investigations for re-introduction according to a project of the Council of Europe. A protected species as of 1986. The established national and natural parks are potential habitats.</p>
		<p><b>Conservation measures needed.</b> Ban on felling in old natural forests. Creation of natural parks in the Western Balkan range, Sredna gora, the Western Rhodopes and enlargement of the Pirin National Park. Under conditions of dispersal and breeding of the species, the protected territories in the future (about 1 million ha) would become refuges for a population of up to 200 lynxes.</p>

		<p><b>General distribution.</b> Europe, Western Siberia, the Caucasus and Asia Minor.</p>
		<p><b>Distribution and abundance in Bulgaria.</b> It inhabits the mountainous regions, in the Ludogorie region it is probably extinct. The numbers have been rapidly declining in the last 30 years [1; 2; Bulgarian Forestries Questionnaire, 1989]. In the 1980s there were about 3 000 individuals [2]. The area of the optimal and suboptimal habitats is under 10 000 sq km, a density of up to 3 individuals at 10 sq km. The numbers (without the cubs) are probably about 1 800 individuals. Most significant are the populations in the Western Rhodope (600 individuals), the Central Balkan range – the genuine Sredna gora (200), Rila (150-200), the Western Balkan range, Pirin and Strandzha (70-90 each). The territorial animals taking part in the breeding constitute about 40% of the population [4].</p>
		<p><b>Habitats.</b> Mainly old, mountainous coniferous (especially spruce) and beech forests over 1 200 m, less often in oak and yoke-elm forests [1; 3; 4].</p>
		<p><b>Biology.</b> The mating season is in the summer; pregnancy lasts 230-270 days; the animals usually start to breed in the third year; the young ones are 3-5 at the average. The young ones may go up to 60 km away from the initial territory [5]; in Central Europe the territories of the mature females are 1.5 sq km at the average, and those of the males 2.3 sq km [6] and may embrace those of more than one female [7]. Basic food: small rodents, birds, squirrels [5; 8].</p>
		<p><b>Similar species.</b> It differs from the stone marten (<i>M. foina</i>) with its (most often) yellowish and non-doubling to the forelegs chest spot, the shorter tail, the large ears and the dark nose.</p>
		<p><b>Negative factors.</b> Intensive restoration felling and reconstruction in the old forests in the last 50 years; fragmentation and isolation of the populations (the Strandzha population is critically endangered) and its ousting by the Stone Marten; accidents on roads; poaching.</p>
		<p><b>Conservation measures taken.</b> The species and its habitats are protected according to the Biological Diversity Act. The Pine Marten is included in the Red Data Book of 1985 as an endangered species. Declaration of vast national and natural parks inhabited by 20% of the population.</p>
		<p><b>Conservation measures needed.</b> Declaration of protected territories and zones for the endangered forest biota in the Western Rhodope, the Balkan range, Pirin, the Ludogorie region and Sredna gora and conservation of old forests in the eco-corridors connecting them. [4]. A moratorium on the use of old forests in the protected territories and zones and in the closed forest basins; restriction of restoration felling and reconstruction in old forests and outside them. Planned increase of the area of centuries-old forests [9]. A common plan with Turkey for a long-term preservation of the forest biota in Strandzha.</p>

		<p><b>Habitats.</b> Steppes. Herbaceous associations in the moderate and the subtropical zones. Pastures. Arable lands.</p>
		<p><b>Biology.</b> The formation of the pairs and the song activity start from the beginning of February. It breeds on the ground. The full clutch is from 3 to 6 eggs that it lays after the middle of April. Along the Black Sea coast there are two clutches yearly [9]. The food consists of insects, and outside the breeding period – more seeds. [9].</p>
		<p><b>Similar species.</b> None.</p>
		<p><b>Negative factors.</b> Loss of habitats; intensive agriculture and use of chemicals; building within the habitats, especially along the Black Sea coast; building of wind turbines in habitats preferred by the species; illegal shooting and hunting tourism.</p>
		<p><b>Conservation measures taken.</b> Protected according to the Biological Diversity Act. Some of the habitats fall within protected territories: Durankulak Protected Locality, Kaliakra Reserve, Yaylite Protected Locality, the Golden Sands Natural Park, Atanasovsko Ezero (lake) Reserve.</p>
		<p><b>Conservation measures needed.</b> Stopping the destruction of the natural steppe and meadow associations along the Black Sea coast. A ban on building in steppe habitats in that part of the country. Creation of new protected territories – of the Besaparski Vazvisheniya (hills), in the major breeding places of the species along the Northern Black Sea coast, in the dry ravines of Dobrudzha and in the area of the town of Sandanski. Strict control on international hunting tourism with respect to the shooting of birds protected according to the Bulgarian legislation. Study of the major sites for concentration during migration and wintering and ensuring their protection.</p>

		<p><b>Conservation status:</b> <i>in Bulgaria:</i>
			<b>Vulnerable VU</b> [D2], BDA-II, III; <i>International:</i> IUCN (2004)-VU [D2], BeC-II.</p>
		<p><b>General distribution.</b> Bulgaria, Southeastern Romania.</p>
		<p><b>Distribution and abundance in Bulgaria.</b> Northern Bulgaria, isolated localities to the south of the Balkan range. More frequently found and more numerous than the great hamster. There are no concrete data about the numbers but they can be estimated as low.</p>
		<p><b>Habitats.</b> Virgin lands, alfalfa and corn fields, vineyards, orchards and vegetable gardens [1, 2]. According to data from the region of Konstanta, Romania [3] it prefers areas occupied by forage cultures, virgin lands, less often settling in corn cultures and the field-protecting belts, practically absent in ploughable cultures.</p>
		<p><b>Biology.</b> It lives in separately dug out holes, similar to those of the European hamster but shallower: the nesting chamber is at a depth of about 50 - 60 cm, rarely up to 1.5 m [4]. It is active mainly during the night, going out in search for food also during the day. Falling into hibernation depends on the ecological conditions, mostly temperatures and population density [2, 3, 5, 6]. It feeds on herbaceous plants, mainly corn and beans, potatoes, seeds (maize, sunflower, wheat, oats, vetch) [2]. Breeding starts in April – May. It yields 2 – 3 clutches a year, with 2 – 10 young ones in a clutch [4]. It falls prey to rapacious birds, usually owls [7, 8, 9, 10, 11]. It competes with the European hamster.</p>
		<p><b>Similar species.</b> The European hamster (<i>Cricetus cricetus</i>), but the Romanian hamster is smaller and only its chest is black.</p>
		<p><b>Negative factors.</b> Industrial agriculture with the use of the technique of deep ploughing and pesticides. Private agriculture of the farmer's type and the fragmentation of the areas and their intensive processing associated with it, with the use of considerable quantities of fertilizers and pesticides.</p>
		<p><b>Conservation measures taken.</b> Included in the the Red Data Book of Bulgaria, 1985, in the <i>rare</i> category, the Berne Convention, Annex II, Annexes 2 and 3 of the Biological Diversity Act. <b>Conservation measures needed.</b> Monitoring studies are necessary for determining the present distribution and the population density. On this basis, regions must be specified for measures to be developed in them for the preservation of the species, with a view to creating territories with an optimal structure of the arable lands and for agricultural practices harmful to the hamster not to be used.</p>

		<p><b>General distribution.</b> Central and Northern Europe – from France to Russia.</p>
		<p><b>Distribution and abundance in Bulgaria.</b> It was found in the Danube River and adjacent marshes, as well as in the lower reaches of some of its tributaries: the rivers Voynishka, Iskar, Vit, Ogosta, Osam, Yantra, Rusenski Lom [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]. There are data that in the past, it ran far upstream the rivers: in the Iskar River it was caught near Roman [2] and in the Yantra River near Byala [5]. It was also recorded in Srebarna Lake [7], Shabla Lake [8, 9] and in the Struma River basin [10]. A rare species with declining abundance. At present, it is found only in the Danube River and the adjacent wetlands – the Orsoya fish ponds, Belene, Kalimok and probably elsewhere [our data]. It is extinct in the Struma River basin [our data] and in Srebarna Lake [11]; its occurrence in Shabla Lake needs confirmation.</p>
		<p><b>Habitats.</b> Permanent rivers and permanent fresh water lakes and marshes. In the past, it was also found in coastal fresh water lagoons.</p>
		<p><b>Biology.</b> It inhabits standing and slow-flowing waters, with sandy or muddy bottom, where it stays buried during the day and when the conditions are unfavouarble (drought). It is sensitive to changes in the atmospheric pressure. It feeds on insect larvae and mollusks [12, 13].</p>
		<p><b>Similar species.</b> None.</p>
		<p><b>Negative factors.</b> The species is sensitive to pollutants which accumulate in the sediment [13]. Another threat is the loss of habitats as a result of draining of marshlands.</p>

		<p><b>General distribution.</b> A species of the Old World with a large distribution in Europe, Asia, Africa, the island of Madagascar, Australia and the Indo-Malayan archipelago. The European population is comparatively small, under 100 000 pairs, with a considerable decrease in 1970-1990, the negative tendency continuing in most of Europe.</p>
		<p><b>Distribution and abundance in Bulgaria.</b> A breeding summer visitor, passage migrant and partly winter visitor. In the past it was comparatively common around the rivers Danube, Maritsa, etc. and along the Black Sea coast [1]. For 1982, numbers of 100-500 pairs were reported [2]. For the recent years the population has been estimated at 130-170 pairs [3]. During the multiplication season it is most frequent along the Danube and its tributaries, the valleys of the rivers Maritsa, Tundzha and their tributaries, in the mountains Sakar and Dervenstski Vuzvisheniya. During wandering and migrations it can be found everywhere around the country, but the migration along the Black Sea coast is more significant.</p>
		<p><b>Habitats.</b> Valley and hilly regions of the country, without the mountainous zone over 1 000 m. It prefers places close to wetlands, even in an increased anthropogenic pressure [4].</p>
		<p><b>Biology.</b> It breeds singularly or in thinned colonies of up to 30 pairs [4]. It gathers in groups during eating, wandering, rest and migration [4]. Polyphagous, it feeds on carrion, often taking the prey of other birds, catches insects and small vertebrate animals [7].</p>
		<p><b>Similar species.</b> The Red Kite (<i>Milvus milvus</i>).</p>
		<p><b>Negative factors.</b> Intensive agriculture and clashes with high-voltage lines, the extraction of inert materials and wood along the valleys of rivers; poisoning, illegal shooting by poachers, industrial and domestic pollution of the soils and the waters.</p>
		<p><b>Conservation measures taken.</b> Protected according to the Biological Diversity Act. Included in the Red Data Book of Bulgaria (1985).</p>
		<p><b>Conservation measures needed.</b> More active preservation and management of the habitats, including wetlands; restriction of the use of poisonous baits and use of chemicals in agriculture; safeguarding high-voltage lines.</p>

		<p>Order Chiroptera</p>
		<p>Family Miniopteridae</p>
		<p><b>Conservation status:</b> <i>in Bulgaria:</i>
			<b>Vulnerable VU</b> [A2c], BDA-II, III; <i>International:</i> IUCN- NT, BeC-II, III, BoC-II, HD-II, IV.</p>
		<p><b>General distribution.</b> Southern Europe, in the north to Central France, Switzerland, Austria and Slovakia and Northern Africa.</p>
		<p><b>Distribution and abundance in Bulgaria.</b> The whole country, without the highest parts of the mountains. About 170 localities are known, most of which are at altitudes between 100 and 600 m [1]. The total numbers are about 170 000 individuals of the wintering population and about 120 000 individuals of the summer population. The difference is probably due to the bats coming from Northern Greece that winter in Dyavolskoto garlo cave (the village of Trigrad). For the cave-loving species of bats, to which Schreiber's bat belongs, a decline of the numbers was found by 20-40% at the average in the 1988-1992 period with respect to the 1955-1971 period [2].</p>
		<p><b>Habitats.</b> Karstic landscapes throughout the country.</p>
		<p><b>Biology.</b> It inhabits all the year round only underground shelters: caves and mine galleries. It forms numerous nursery colonies. Known are 19 nursery colonies and five summer non-nursery colonies. The maximum of birth givings is in the period 20 June – 10 July. It winters only in underground shelters. 14 winter shelters are known but over 95% of the wintering population is in three caves: Parnitsite, Devetashkata, Dyavolsko garlo. They make regular seasonal migrations between the shelters (50-150 km).</p>
		<p><b>Similar species.</b> None.</p>
		<p><b>Negative factors.</b> Anthriopogenic pressure on the shelters: direct disturbance and driving away, hindering the access and a change of the microclimate (placing doors, bars, etc.). The caves Magura, Devetashka, Emenska, Dyavolsko garlo have turned into objects of increased tourism not conforming to the requirements for the preservation of bats. Anthropogenic changes of hunting habitats and flight corridors, but concrete data in the country for them are absent.</p>
		<p><b>Conservation measures taken.</b> Protected according to the Biological Diversity Act, EUROBATS and all the other conventions (without CITES). Many of the underground shelters in Bulgaria fall within different categories of protected territories. The inclusion in the <i>Natura 2000</i> network of protected zones of the known shelters is about to be effected.</p>
		<p><b>Conservation measures needed.</b> Preservation of underground shelters. Working out detailed management plans for those that are declared protected territories. Studies for clarifying the "interim" (spring and autumn) copulative shelters (swarming sites) and the concrete hunting habitats and flight corrdors so that they should also be protected. Continuation of the yearly monitoring in the significant underground shelters of bats [3].</p>

		<p><b>Conservation status:</b> <i>in Bulgaria:</i>
			<b>Extinct EX</b>. It is considered extinct after 1997 in the Black Sea [1]. Last observed in Bulgaria: 1995-6; <i>International</i>: IUCN – CR; BeC-II; CITES – I; BoC-I, II; HD-II, IV.</p>
		<p><b>General distribution.</b> Separate localities from the Eastern Mediterranean to Mauritania. From the Northern and the Western Black Sea it disappeared between the 1950s and the 1970s, and from the Eastern Black Sea in the 1930s (?). Until the 1980s, the major nucleus of the Black Sea population was preserved in Turkey. After 1997, the species most probably completely disappeared also there. It is possible that a small number of seals are still living along the Turkish shore of the Sea of Marmara.</p>
		<p><b>Distribution and abundance in Bulgaria.</b> Until the beginning of the 1920s, it was present along the Dobrudzha shore [2,3] and entered the river Danube up to the Ruse region. Its main habitats were Cape Kaliakra (1936 – 128 seals), Maslen nos and the Strandzha shore. At the end of the 1970s, it was probably still permanent also near Kaliakra and the village of Rezovo [4]. To the north of Burgas after 1980 it was already rare [5]. Last observations were made near Kaliakra and Balchik – between 1990 and 1992; there was one corpse washed ashore near Balchik in 1994; it was seen in 1994 between Tyulenovo and Kamen bryag, and also near Shabla [6,7]. A carcass was washed ashore near Durankulak in 1996 [8]. Along the southern shore it was present (and perhaps it bred) in the 1980s until the beginning of the 1990s, near Sozopol, Maslen nos, Zmiyski island, Tsarevo and Rezovo: several observations were made on a couple, a group of 4 individuals, young animals, singular seals on the shore. Last observations made there: Malak Silistar, 1993, and a dead seal on the shore in 1994; St. Ivan island, 1994 in the belted bonito season; the region of Sinemorets, in the spring of 1995 [6].</p>
		<p><b>Habitats.</b> In the past there were abodes with 50-100 animals each (for example, Cape Kaliakra and to the north of it). In the last decades small groups or individuals inhabited empty small bays and rock shores. Caves inhabited until recently are known in the regions of Kaliakra, Maslen nos, the Ropotamo reserve and between Sinemorets and Rezovo [7].</p>
		<p><b>Biology.</b> It gives birth to young mainly at the end of the summer and the beginning of the autumn, in isolated places on the shore or in caves with an entrance, often under the water. Sexual maturity: 4 years. Pregnancy: 11 months. Food: fish [9, 10].</p>
		<p><b>Negative factors.</b> trouble; destruction of the shores; illegal killing; pollution of the sea and the shore with mazut, industrial waters, pesticides, etc.; reduction of the Black Sea fish reserves.</p>
		<p><b>Conservation measures taken</b>. Protected in Bulgaria from the end of the 19th century. Included in the Red Book (1985) as a threatened species. Reintroduction in appropriate sites is the last possibility for restoring of the population, but overbuilding of the shore makes this almost impossible.</p>

			<b>Vulnerable VU</b> C[2(a(i)] + D [1], BDA-II, III; <i>International:</i> BeC-II, ESC-Spec 3.</p>
		<p><b>General distribution.</b> A Paleo-Xeromontane species whose breeding area embraces the southern parts of Europe (in the north to Switzerland and Austria), Asia and Africa. It winters in Southern Asia, Western and Central Africa. In most of the area it is found all the year round.</p>
		<p><b>Distribution and abundance in Bulgaria.</b> Resident. It was found for the first time near Studen Kladenets Reservoir in the 60s of the previous century [1, 2]. At present, the national population is mainly concentrated in the rock complexes and the surrounding shrub associations and pastures along the valleys of the rivers Arda (mainly between the city of Kardzhali and the town of Madzharovo), Mesta (mainly between the towns of Dobrinishte and Gotse Delchev) and Struma (the southern part of Kresna Gorge) [3]. In the southern part of Kresna Gorge it has a comparatively low frequency (is found less often) and a density of 1,10 breeding pairs/km2 [4]. The total numbers in the country are between 250 and 450 breeding pairs [3].</p>
		<p><b>Habitats.</b> Rocky regions, stony shores and seaside slopes, in combination with bushy vegetation of the Mediterranean type.</p>
		<p><b>Biology.</b> It breeds in rock cracks (most often at a height of about 3 m) and in abandoned stone buildings. It lays 3-6 eggs in April - May [1]. It mainly feeds on invertebrate animals but also on lizards with vegetation components [1].</p>

		<p>Order Carnivora</p>
		<p>Family Mustelidae</p>
		<p><b>Conservation status:</b> <i>in Bulgaria</i>: <b>Vulnerable VU </b>[A3c], BDA-II, III; <i>International:</i> BeC-II, HD-IV.</p>
		<p><b>General distribution.</b> From the open spaces of Central Asia and Russia to Southeast Poland, the Ukraine, Moldova and Romania; isolated in the Czech Republic, Southern Slovakia, Eastern Austria, Hungary and Northeastern Serbia.</p>
		<p><b>Distribution and abundance in Bulgaria.</b> A relict from the Pleistocene, with an area changing in the Holocene for climatic and anthropogenic reasons [1; 2]. Bulgaria is the southern periphery of the species area in Europe. Most probably, the subspecies <i>M. e. eversmanii</i> Lesson inhabits Bulgaria, particularly the Eastern and Central part of Northern Bulgaria on about 20 000 km2: mainly in Dobrudzha, to the west it reaches Chomakovtsi (Cherven Bryag) and Kneja (Y. Koshev, 2007 - personal communication); in the southeast the Eastern Balkan range to Beronovo, Daskotna and the Aytos pass; an unsure report for the Sofia region (N. Kodzhabashev, personal communication, 2001). The numbers are about 2 000 individuals (without the cubs), with a probable density in Dobrudzha of 1 individual per 5.5 km2, and a density of 1 individual per 12 km2 in the rest of the territory. Observed rarely (in Dobrudzha more than 16 reports, outside that area only 5-6 known reports) [3; 4; 5].</p>
		<p><b>Habitats.</b> Steppe territories, also agricultural lands where it makes shelters in the field boundaries and the riverside shrubs and forests; meadows and clearings. It uses river valleys and passes for ecological corridors [3; 5].</p>
		<p><b>Biology.</b> Polygamous. Sexually mature at the age of 10-11 months. Oestrus: February – March, pregnancy 36-38 days, it gives birth to 7-12 young ones. It uses the holes of sousliks, hamsters, and mole rats (that it enlarges), of foxes and badgers, or makes its own shelters; less frequently in rock cracks, roots and haylofts. It covers 4-7 km per day. In the Ukraine, the density is 0.05 – 6 individuals per 10 km2, in the winter it inhabits up to 3 km2. Basic prey: sousliks, hamsters, small rodents, [5; 6; 7; 8].</p>
		<p><b>Similar species.</b> The European polecat (<i>M. putorius</i>), from which it differs with the lighter colouration, the pale transocular "mask" and the light base of the tail [8].</p>
		<p><b>Negative factors.</b> Turning meadows and pastures into arable lands; intensive agriculture (blocks with monocultures, destruction of the field boundaries, use of pesticides and artificial fertilizers). Decrease of the numbers of the major prey. Fragmentation of the habitats by transport corridors and accidents on the roads. Human poaching.</p>
		<p><b>Conservation measures taken.</b> A protected species. Included in the Bulgarian Red Data Book of 1985. A protection campaign was carried out by the Wilderness Fund Society (1997-2000).</p>
		<p><b>Conservation measures needed.</b> Declaration of important habitats of the steppe faunistic complex protected territories and protected zones.

		<h1>European Mink</h1>
		<p><b><i>Mustela lutreola</i></b> (Linnaeus, 1761)</p>
		<p>Order Carnivora Bowdich, 1821</p>
		<p>Family Mustelidae G. Fischer, 1817</p>
		<p><b>Conservation status:</b> <i>in Bulgaria</i>: <b>Extinct EX</b>. Evidence of the presence of the species at the relevant time is rare and not certain. There is no reliable information about its existence after 1951-1952; <i>International</i>: IUCN-VU, BeC.</p>
		<p><b>General distribution.</b> The area of the European Mink embraced Europe (without the southern parts and without Scandinavia), reaching Western Siberia. Today the species inhabits about 1/5 of its former territory, mainly in Russia.</p>
		<p><b>Distribution and abundance in Bulgaria.</b> The European Mink is supposed to have inhabited the Danube islands and the shore in the regions of Svishtov, Ruse, Tutrakan and Silistra [1]. The information about a European Mink caught at the end of the 1930s in the marshes near Silistra [2] was based on a misunderstanding. The species was identified by Dr. N. Atanassov by the fur of an animal caught, according to the information, in the river Danube, to the east of Svishtov, in 1951-1952 [3]. According to unreliable evidence of local hunters, European Minks inhabit the Srebarna reserve (V. Popov, Inst. of Zoology, BAS, pers. comm.). In the 1980s, in Romania less than 100 furs were produced yearly [4]. The yield was mainly from the Danube delta. Today there is still a stable population there [5].</p>
		<p><b>Habitats</b>. The European Mink lives a semi-water borne life. It inhabits the banks of natural water basins with flowing waters and overgrown with vegetation, often marshy shores.</p>
		<p><b>Biology.</b> The individual section along the river valleys is between 250 and 2000 m. Its basic food consists of rodents, fish, also frogs and crayfish. It usually gives birth to 3-4, sometimes over 10 young [6].</p>
		<p><b>Similar species.</b> The American mink, <i>M. vison</i> and the Western polecat (<i>M. putorius</i>). It differs from <i>Mustela vison</i> by the large white spot over the muzzle and the upper lip; it differs from the Black polecat in the lighter colouring and the long tail (over 1/3 of the length of the trunk) [7].</p>
		<p><b>Negative factors.</b> Basically: the anthropogenic destruction of the shore habitats [8] and probably the pollution of the waters; in the past – commercial trapping for the valuable fur. The habitats in Bulgaria are in the southern periphery of the species area, an additional factor for the vulnerability of the population. Influence is exerted by the competitors, such as the American mink, the otter, and partly by the western polecat.</p>
		<p><b>Conservation measure taken.</b> The species has been protected in Bulgaria by law since 1962. It is included in the Red Book of Bulgaria, 1985, as probably extinct.</p>

		<h1>Bechstein's Bat</h1>
		<p><b><i>Myotis bechsteinii</i></b> (Kuhl, 1817)</p>
		<p>Order Chiroptera</p>
		<p>Family Vespertilionidae</p>
		<p><b>Conservation status:</b> <i>in Bulgaria:</i>
			<b>Vulnerable VU </b>[B1 b(i, ii, iv)], BDA-II, III; <i>International:</i> IUCN-VU; BeC-II, BoC-II, HD-II, IV.</p>
		<p><b>General distribution.</b> Europe, in the north to Southern Sweden, in the east to the Caucasus Mountains, Azerbaijan and Northern Iran.</p>
		<p><b>Distribution and abundance in Bulgaria.</b> It was found for the first time in Bulgaria at the mouth of the river Kamchiya [1]. Until 1985, seven localities were known [2] and 34 localities until the end of 2006 [3], whereby 14 are situated at altitudes under 300 m, 8 are within altitudes of 301 – 1 000 m, and the rest are over 1 000 m. The highest locality is the Sharaliyska cave (1650 m) in Pirin. Highest is the density between 1 000 m and 1 400 m (an average of 8.2 individuals from 12 habitats), in regions with vast and compact forest massifs (the Central Balkan range, the Western Rhodopes, Strandzha). It is rare in the Danube Plain and absent in the open parts of Thrace.</p>
		<p><b>Habitats</b>. A typical inhabitant of old deciduous forests. Its numbers are highest in mesophilous forest massifs with permanent water basins, in the lowlands with a predomination of different species of oak and ash-tree, and in the mountains of beech. Singular individuals live in hollows in trees with a diameter of the trunk 13-20 cm at a height from the ground 0.7-5 m; colonies have been found only in older trees with a diameter of 40-55 cm at a height of 5-12 m [3]. Only two individuals have been found in caves during the winter. It has been found once in bat boxes (Ropotamo reserve).</p>
		<p><b>Biology.</b> The males most often live singularly and the females in small groups (of 5-10 individuals) or in colonies (of 10-30 individuals). The females have a strong attachment to the region of the tree hollow in which they were born [4]. The individual hunting area is small: 0,6 – 1 ha, often overlapping between the individuals of one colony. A stationary species that rarely makes longer migrations (a maximum of 60 km) [6]. In Bulgaria a vertical migration of 770 m has been registered between the shelter to the place of catching (2.7 km) [3]. In June it gives birth to 1 young suckled for about 3 weeks. From the end of August to the end of September, Bechstein's bats (about 90% male individuals, 10% female individuals) gather near the entrances of caves or of abandoned mine galleries with the aim of finding partners [3, 5].</p>
		<p><b>Similar species.</b> It differs from the other representatives of the genus <i>Myotis</i>, except the greater and lesser mouse-eared bat (<i>Myotis myoti</i>,<i> M. blythii</i>), by its longer ears, and from the latter two species by its smaller size – the length of the forearm is under 50 mm.</p>
		<p><b>Negative factors.</b> Selective felling of trees that are old and with hollows reduces the possibilities for finding appropriate shelters. Fragmentation of the compact forest habitats and discontinuation of the links between them.</p>
		<p><b>Conservation measures taken.</b> The species is protected according to the Biological Diversity Act, EUROBATS and all the other conventions (without CITES). Over 200 bat houses installed in 7 places in the country are included for monitoring in the National System for Biological Monitoring.</p>
		<p><b>Conservation measures needed.</b> Development of a management plan for the forest loving species of bats in Bulgaria. Carrying out focused monitoring in its more significant habitats. Declaration of the most important autumn swarming sites protected territories. Installation of bat boxes.</p>

		<p><b>Conservation status:</b> <i>in Bulgaria:</i> Vulnerable VU [A2c], BDA-II, III; <i>International:</i> IUCN-VU [A2c], BeC-II, III, BoC-II, HD-II, IV.</p>
		<p><b>General distribution.</b> Mediterranean parts of Europe (in the north up to Italy and Romania), Northwestern Africa, Southern Asia Minor, Israel, Southern Iraq, Southern Iran.</p>
		<p><b>Distribution and abundance in Bulgaria.</b> Throughout the country, without the highest parts of the mountains. 73 shelters are known, most of them between 100 and 600 m altitude [1]. The total summer number is about 18 500 individuals. During the winter, when individuals from the surrounding countries migrate to Bulgaria and the numbers are about 45 000 individuals. For the cave loving species of bats, to which the long-fingered bat belongs, a decrease of the numbers has been registered by 20-40% at the average in the 1988-1992 period with respect to the 1955-1971 period [2].</p>
		<p><b>Habitats.</b> Karstic landscapes. It inhabits all the year round only underground shelters: caves and mine galleries.</p>
		<p><b>Biology.</b> It feeds exclusively on insects over water basins. It forms nursery colonies numbering between several tens to several thousands of individuals. Known in the country are 21 nursery colonies and eight summer non-nursery colonies. The maximum of birth-givings is in the period 20-25 May. It winters only in underground shelters. 15 winter shelters are known but more than 95% of the wintering population is concentrated in three caves: Parnitsite, Devetashkata and Ivanova voda. It makes regular seasonal migrations between the winter and the summer roosts (50-150 km).</p>
		<p><b>Similar species.</b> Daubenton's bat (<i>Myotis daubentonii</i>) and the pond bat (<i>Myotis dasycneme</i>).</p>
		<p><b>Negative factors.</b> As this is a markedly colonial species, linked exclusively with underground shelters and because of the fact that most of the population of the Balkan Peninsula winters in three caves in Bulgaria, it is vulnerable by the anthropogenic pressure on the shelters (destruction, cave tourism, agricultural and animal breeding activities), leading to a disturbance and a change of the microclimate in them, for example the caves Magura, Devetashkata, Emenskata, etc. Anthropogenic degradation of the hunting habitats and the flight corridors linked with them. Destruction of the natural open water areas (lakes, marshes, river arms).</p>
		<p><b>Conservation measures taken.</b> Protected according to the Biological Diversity Act, EUROBATS and all the other conventions (without CITES). Many of the underground shelters in Bulgaria fall within different categories of protected territories. The inclusion of the known shelters in the <i>Natura 2000</i> network of protected zones is about to be effected.</p>
		<p><b>Conservation measures needed.</b> Protection of underground shelters. Working out detailed management plans for those that are declared protected territories. Additional studies for explaining the &quot;interim&quot; (spring and autumn) copulative shelters (swarming sites) and of concrete hunting habitats and flight corridors, so that they can be protected as well. Continuation of the yearly monitoring in the significant underground shelters of bats [3].</p>

		<p><b><i>Myotis emarginatus </i> (Geoffroy, 1806)</b></p>
		<p>Order Chiroptera</p>
		<p>Family Vespertilionidae</p>
		<p><b>Conservation status:</b> <i>in Bulgaria:</i>
			<b>Vulnerable VU</b> [B1 b(i, ii, iv)], BDA-II, III; <i>International:</i> IUCN-VU, BeC-II, BoC-II, HD-II, IV.</p>
		<p><b>General distribution.</b> Central and Southern Europe, in the north to Southern Poland and the Netherlands, in the east to Afganistan, Eastern Iran and Uzbekistan. Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia and Lebanon.</p>
		<p><b>Distribution and abundance in Bulgaria.</b> Known are 73 localities, situated throughout the country [1], whereby 31 of these were reported before 1985. Most roosts and colonies have been registered in the low mountainous belt (at altitudes of up to 400-500 m). Singular individuals have been registered at altitudes of up to about 1 600 m in the Central Balkan range [2], at an altitude of 1550 m in Rila [1], 1 560 m altitude in the Western Rhodopes [3]. In the ca. 30 nursery colonies known so far, the number of individuals is between 300 and 600. Record numbers, about 7 000 individuals, have been found in a cave in the Eastern Rhodopes [4].</p>
		<p><b>Habitats.</b> A characteristic inhabitant of low-mountainous karstic regions [1, 5]. It settles in caves, abandoned buildings, old military bumkers, etc. A thermophilous species. The temperature in the nursery roosts may reach 35 &deg;C [6].</p>
		<p><b>Biology.</b> The nursery colonies mainly consist of female individuals, most frequently mixed with horseshoe bats. Before the middle of August, soon after all the young are able to fly, the colony leaves the shelter and settles in another near or distant retreat. Registered in Bulgaria is one of the longest migrations of the species (105 km): from the village of Muselievo, Nikopol region, to the cave Vodnite dupki in the Central Balkan range [7]. It mainly feeds on spiders, flies, lacewings and less frequently on butterflies. During the winter only singular individuals are found in Bulgaria, in caves. Due to the higher numbers, the populations in the Balkan peninsula are considered to be an important genetic reserve for the species [8].</p>
		<p><b>Similar species.</b> It differs from the similarly sized representatives of the genus <i>Myotis</i> with the well marked clip in the distal half of the external edge of the ear.</p>
		<p><b>Negative factors.</b> Disturbance during the breeding period (June-July). When driven away and in the absence of an alternative shelter in the same area, the colonies fall apart and the breeding success is almost nil [7]. Overgrowing or collapsing of the entrances of the shelters leads to their temporary or permanent abandonment.</p>
		<p><b>Conservation measures taken.</b> The species is protected according to the Biological Diversity Act, EUROBATS and all the other conventions (without CITES). Some its known habitats fall within reserves (for example Ropotamo), in national (the Central Balkans) and natural parks (Vratsa Balkans), in protected localities (for example, Gyurgena near Madzharovo) or are declared natural sites (for example, the caves Nanin kamak, Nikopol region, Yagodinska, Smolyan region; Devetashka, Lovech region, etc.). Most of the important habitats are included in the List of Significant Underground Habitats of Bats [9].</p>
		<p><b>Conservation measures needed.</b> Declaration of territories of shelters that accommodate nursery colonies as protected. Organizing focused monitoring and taking management measures for ensuring a better protection for the damaged habitats.</p>

		<p><b>General distribution.</b> Southeastern Bulgaria, Turkish Thracia, the Mediterranean coast of Asia Minor.</p>
		<p><b>Distribution and abundance in Bulgaria.</b> The low parts of Southeastern Bulgaria. The numbers are unknown.</p>
		<p><b>Habitats.</b> Open spaces, non-arable lands or the environs of oats, wheat and maize fields, almond gardens, deserted vineyards. In similar habitats it has been registered also in Turkish Thrace [1]. It avoids the forests.</p>
		<p><b>Biology.</b> It digs holes at a depth of about 10 - 20 cm; the tunnels have several exits; in the bottom is a nesting chamber with a nest, built from dry grass. Its activity is on the ground, but just like many other rodents it climbs well: in Turkish Thrace most individuals were caught on trees [1]. It is mainly active during the night. It spends the winter hibernating, in holes under the ground, from the second half of November to the first half of April. It has one generation per year. Copulation is probably at the end of April and the first half of May. They give birth in the second half of May and the beginning of June. The number of young per young female is 5 – 6, and in adults probably more. The females become sexually mature after the first wintering [2].</p>
		<p><b>Negative factors.</b> The species is well adapted to agricultural landscapes. In Bulgaria it is found in regions with a predominant traditional agriculture whose intensity in recent years decreased. Thus it is not directly threatened by the trends in agriculture, but the northwestern habitats are in an industrially degraded area. The enormous infrastructure facilities, the open mines and the thick road network etc. in the Stara Zagora – Radnevo – Maritsa Iztok region have undoubtedly destroyed some of the localities of the species.</p>

		<p><b>Habitats.</b> The nymph inhabits the lentic zone in rivers and streams where the current is weak and the substrate is covered with detritus, algae, mosses and other macrophytes in summer [3]. It occurs around water plants, among the intertwined roots of seed plants, branches or deposits, under large flat stones, and often among mosses (<i>Fontinalis antipyrica</i>) [4].</p>
		<p><b>Biology.</b> The nymphs crawl slowly and are bad swimmers. The last instar nymphs develop in May and June [3], the adult usually emerges on the following day after the appearance of the subimago. A mass flight of adults over the surface of large rivers is observed early in the morning [5]. The females lay eggs on the surface of the water at sunrise [6].</p>
		<p><b>Negative factors.</b> Destruction of the natural habitats caused by man. Extraction of inert materials from the bottoms of rivers. <i>Neoephemera maxima</i> is a markedly sensitive species to the cleanliness of the river water and hence is especially vulnerable to pollution with industrial and home waste waters.</p>
		<p><b>Conservation measures taken.</b> None.</p>
		<p><b>Conservation measures needed.</b> Prevention of pollution in the middle and lower courses of the larger rivers, where there exists a possibility for finding the species. Restoration and protection of the natural living conditions in its potential habitats.</p>

		<p><b><i>Nerophis ophidion</i></b> (Linnaeus, 1758)</p>
		<p>Order Syngnathiformes</p>
		<p>Family Syngnathidae</p>
		<p><b>Conservation status:</b> <i>in Bulgaria</i>: <b>Endangered EN </b>[B2b (i, ii)].</p>
		<p><b>General distribution.</b> The species inhabits the British Isles and the Atlantic coast from Trondheim (Norway) to Northern Morocco, the Mediterranean and adjacent seas: the Adriatic Sea, the Aegean Sea, the Sea of Marmara and the Black Sea.</p>
		<p><b>Distribution and abundance in Bulgaria.</b> In the past, it was found everywhere along the Bulgarian Black Sea coast, in the rivers Kamchiya, Ropotamo, Veleka and in some of the coastal lakes – Durankulak, Varna, Beloslav, Burgas and Mandra [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. Recently, single specimens have been caught in the region of Cape Kaliakra, Varna Bay and the Dyavolska River [6, 7, 8].</p>
		<p><b>Habitats.</b> A phytophylic species. It stays close to the shore, usually amidst the eel-grass fields (<i>Zostera </i>sp.).</p>
		<p><b>Biology.</b> It spawns repeatedly from May to August. The females attach their eggs to the male ventral surface in front of the anal opening. The fecundity varies from 28 to 70 eggs. The straightnose pipefish is the only species of the family, which has a free larval stage due to preserved embryonal fins. Juveniles are found in the algae zone from June to early September [3]. It feeds on plankton and fish fry [2, 9].</p>
		<p><b>Similar species.</b> Another six species of pipefishes are found along the Bulgarian Black Sea coast: <i>Syngnathus abaster</i>, <i>S. acus</i>, <i>S. schmidti</i>, <i>S. typhle</i>,<i> S. tenuirostris and S. variegatus</i>. The straightnose pipefish differs from them by the absence of a well-differentiated brood pouch and a reduced caudal fin.</p>
		<p><b>Negative factors.</b> The main threat to the species is water pollution.</p>
		<p><b>Conservation measures taken.</b> The species was listed in the Red Book of the Black Sea (1999).</p>
		<p><b>Conservation measures needed.</b> Protection of the lower reaches of the Black Sea rivers, the coastal lakes and the Black Sea coast against pollution.</p>

		<p><b>General distribution.</b> A Sarmatian species irregularly breeding in isolated places in Central and Southern Europe and Asia Minor. The area is more compact in the European part of Russia and Asia. It winters along the coasts of the Mediterranean, the Black Sea and the Caspian Sea, in the Middle East and India. In Europe there is a tendency for an increase of the population.</p>
		<p><b>Distribution and abundance in Bulgaria.</b> Currently passage migrant and wintering species, in the past it was reported as a common breeding species for the Black Sea coast. It has been observed in small numbers in wetlands along the Danube River: Belene, Srebarna. It has also been found breeding in the lakes Shabla and Durankulak, in the Burgas lakes, etc. [1, 2]. Since the beginning and the middle of the 1990s, there has been no confirmed breeding of the species in Bulgaria. It is possible for singular pairs to be making attempts at breeding in separate years or at staying in the country, but since the 1990s there have been no data of nests or young birds found [3, 4] so far. In the winter it was found in largest numbers in Burgas Bay (700 in 1941) [5] and in Varna lake (320 individuals in 1984); after 1988 the winter numbers of the species in Bulgaria decreased considerably [6].</p>
		<p><b>Habitats.</b> Marshes and lakes with rich submerged vegetation and large reed reedbeds. During migrations and wintering along the Black Sea coast, where it prefers staying in isolated small bays.</p>
		<p><b>Biology.</b> It starts breeding in the second half of April. It most frequently incubates on the shore in high marshy vegetation. The nest is covered with down, it usually lays 8-10 eggs. It mainly feeds on vegetation: seeds, leaves, stalks and other parts of water and hydrophyte plants (mostly charophytic algae). It obtains its food under the water surface, by dipping the head, the bill or the front part of the body.</p>
		<p><b>Similar species.</b> Monotypical; there are no similar species.</p>
		<p><b>Negative factors.</b> Destruction and degradation of habitats; industrial fishing with nets; pollution of basins.</p>
		<p><b>Conservation measures taken.</b> A protected species since 1962. Included in the Red Data Book of Bulgaria (1985) as a rare species. Some of the major habitats along the Danube are declared protected territories: Orsoya Fishponds, Srebarna Lake, Kalimok and Belene Island; a restoration of the water regime is envisaged for the latter two wetland areas. The breeding habitats along the Black Sea coast, Yatata and Poda, are also protected. Plans have been drafted for the management of Poda and Srebarna; a national plan is to be prepared for the preservation of the species; plans for the management and restoration of wetlands – important former breeding habitats in the country. Possibilities are also being discussed for working out appropriate agro-ecological measures for fish farms with the aim of attracting the species to breed, as well as a programme for breeding in closed space, aimed at restoring the species in wild nature.</p>

		<p><b>General distribution.</b> A species with a Siberian type of distribution and on the threshold of full extinction. In the past it inhabited the zone of the forest steppes from Ural to the valley of the river Ob. In the 70s, a drastic decrease of the population was registered. For the period 1990-1999, the data on Europe did not exceed 100 birds. Probably it still winters along the Mediterranean coast of Africa and some countries of Southern Europe, Asia Minor and the Near East.</p>
		<p><b>Distribution and abundance in Bulgaria.</b> A passage migrant and winter visitor that at the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th was found along the Black Sea coast in numbers up to 80 [1], and up to 40 individuals around Sofia [2]. Observed along the shore lakes, along the Dobrudzha shore, in the Sofia region, the Thracian lowland, near the city of Pleven [2,3,4,5,6,7] and along the valleys of the rivers Maritsa and Iskar [8]. In the 1930s it was rare, but a regular migrant mostly for the region of Burgas [9, 10]. After 1946 it was very rare during migrations and wintering (with maximum numbers between 4-7 individuals), mainly along the Black Sea coast: the wetlands around Burgas [11,12], the lakes Shabla and Durankulak [13]. A bird from Atanasovsko Ezero lake was ringed in 1981 [14]. The 48 individuals reported for Atanasovsko Ezero lake in April 1986 [15] remain dubious. Since 1985 it has been observed around Burgas [15,16,19,20,21]: in Atanasovsko Ezero lake – 1 individual on 18 October 1993 [16], between 4 – 9 individuals (2 young) in the period 11-19 April 1996, 1 individual on 18-19 May 1996 [17, 18]*; 1 individual on 06 June 1996 [19]; in Pomoriysko Ezero lake – 1 individual on 03 September 1996 (N. Todorov, in writing), 6 individuals observed by K. Bedev (personal communication) on 12 April 1999*; in the Chengene-Skele Bay – 1 individual on 16-17 November 1993 [16] and near the village of Lyahovo, in the area of the town of Balchik in 1993 [21]. During the mid-winter counts the speices was reported twice: 2 individuals in Chengene-Skele Bay and 1 individual in Atanasovsko Ezero lake in 1993 [22]. The systemic studies undertaken from 1993 onwards [16,20,22] established the presence of a small number of birds, hence the reports of 178 birds in the lakes Atanasovsko and Pomoriysko for the period 1993-2002, and between 33-72 individuals for 1993, 1996 and 1999 [23], are treated with reservations. At present, the key sites are Atanasovsko Ezero lake, the Poda locality and Chengene-Skele Bay. Since 1999 there have been no confirmed observations in Bulgaria. It is possible for singular birds or small groups consisting of 2-3 individuals to pass through the country every year [26].</p>
		<p><b>Habitats.</b> Dry and wet meadows and pastures in the vicinities of lakes, marshes, bogs, sea shallows, lagoons, etc.</p>
		<p><b>Biology.</b> It feeds in shallow basins on benthic invertebrates, probably sea worms, small crustaceans and mollusks, and in dry pastures in Dobrudzha on small snails [3, 26].</p>
		<p><b>Similar species.</b> The Curlew(<i>Numenius arquata</i>), the Whimbrel (<i>Numenius phaeopus</i>).</p>
		<p><b>Negative factors.</b> Drying up of wetlands, changes in the mode of management of agricultural areas, infrastructure development, illegal shooting, pollution of the waters.</p>
		<p><b>Conservation measures taken.</b> Protected according to the Biological Diversity Act. Signed by Bulgaria is a Memorandum of Consent for the Conservation of the Slender-billed Curlew. A National Action Plan has been developed for its conservation for the period 2002-2006 [26].</p>
		<p><b>Conservation measures needed.</b> The sites with more than one observation of the species must be placed under maximum protection as Protected Areas according to the Biological Diversity Act. Development of Management Plans for the Pomoriysko Lake and Chengene-Skele Bay protected localities; monitoring of the territory and the vicinities of the places critical for the species.</p>

		<h1>Greater Noctule</h1>
		<p><b><i>Nyctalus lasiopterus </i> (Schreber, 1780)</b></p>
		<p><i>Pterygistes maximus</i> Fatio: Buresch, 1917: 152-154; <i>Vesperugo noctula </i>Schreb. var <i>maxima</i> Kovachev, 1925: 61-63; <i>Nyctalus siculus</i> Palumbo: Peshev &amp; Boev, 1962: 473.</p>
		<p>Order Chiroptera</p>
		<p>Family Vespertilionidae</p>
		<p><b>Conservation status:</b> <i>in Bulgaria:</i> Vulnerable VU [B1 b(i, ii, iv)], BDA-II, III; <i>International:</i> IUCN-LR/nt, BeC-II, BoC-II, HD-II, IV.</p>
		<p><b>General distribution.</b> From the Atlantic coast of Europe (France, Spain, Portugal), through Southern Poland in the north, to the Caucasus Mountains, Iran, the Usturt plateau in Kazakhstan in the east and Gibraltar, Sicily, and Southern Greece in the south. It is rare in the whole range. Almost everywhere, apart from the Iberian peninsula, only singular individuals have been found.</p>
		<p><b>Distribution and abundance in Bulgaria.</b> One of the rarest bats in Bulgaria, known from 11 localities [1, 2], 10 of them being in Southern Bulgaria. Of these, 5 are in Strandzha, where it does not seem to be so rare. The locality near the village of Tabachka (Ruse region) is from owl pellets [4]. Since its registering in Bulgaria in 1917 [3], only 11 individuals have been caught so far. In the Western Rhodopes it has been registered at altitudes of up to 1 250 m, the village of Buynovo [5]. The data are insufficient to determine its numbers.</p>
		<p><b>Habitats.</b> The greater noctule is a flier of free spaces. In the whole range it is most numerous in deciduous forests, less often in mixed ones. It has also been found in town parks. It is registered all the year round in hollows of old trees. Singular individuals have been found in rock cracks, less often in buildings. It can probably be found in many places not only in the lowlands of Bulgaria, as has been the case for Greece [6].</p>
		<p><b>Biology.</b> One of the most understudied bats in Europe. So far there have been no data about its breeding in Bulgaria. The nursery colonies are small (about 10 individuals, rarely more) and live in holes of trees. The females give birth at the beginning of June: two, less often one, young. The food range is understudied but it is known to prefer large butterflies and beetles. The only European species of bat that also attacks small passeriform birds, especially during migration [7]. A seasonally migrating species. In Bulgaria it has been registered only from May to September.</p>
		<p><b>Similar species.</b> The noctule bat (<i>Nyctalus noctula</i>), from which differs with its larger dimensions: the length of the forearm is over 60 mm.</p>
		<p><b>Negative factors.</b> Felling trees with hollows and the decrease of the area of old forests reduces the possibilities for finding appropriate shelters. The insufficient quantity of large flying insects probably restricts its access to appropriate food.</p>
		<p><b>Conservation measures taken.</b> The species is protected according to the Biological Diversity Act, EUROBATS and all the other conventions (without CITES). Only a small part of the registered habitats fall within the natural parks (Strandzha and the Rila Monastery).</p>
		<p><b>Conservation measures needed.</b> A targeted study on the distribution and the biology of the species. Development of a management plan for the forest species of bats.</p>

			<b>Vulnerable VU </b>[B1 b(i, ii, iv)], BDA-II, III; <i>International:</i> IUCN-LR/nt, BeC-II, BoC-II, HD-II, IV.</p>
		<p><b>General distribution.</b> Western and Central Europe, rare in the countries of the Mediterranean region, in the east to the state of Utar Pradesh in India, in the south to Northern Africa.</p>
		<p><b>Distribution and abundance in Bulgaria.</b> It has been found in 16 localities, most of which are at altitudes of under 800 m [1, 2]. Until 1985, 6 localities were known. Two of its localities in Northern Bulgaria (Bozhichen and Svalenik, Ruse region) are from owl pellets [3]. It has not been found in a vast part of the territory of the country. The highest altitudes at which it has been found (1 500 m) are in the Central Balkan range, Pleven hut [4]. More than half of its contemporary localities (6) are in Strandzha.</p>
		<p><b>Habitats.</b> A typical inhabitant of forest habitats in the low and middle mountainous belt. A flier of free spaces. In most parts of the continent it lives mainly in hollows of trees. In Eire many of its colonies are in human buildings (atticks of houses, churches, etc.). Most of its habitats are in large forest massifs or immediately close to them. In Central Europe it often settles in bat houses. In Bulgaria it has been found in bat boxes over the Sedemte Prestola monastery in the Western Balkan range and also in houses for birds around Chernomorets, to the south of Burgas. Probably it is found everywhere in the lowlands of Bulgaria, as has been established for Greece [5].</p>
		<p><b>Biology.</b> Understudied. It feeds on butterflies, beetles, lacewings, caddisflies and other insects. So far there has been no sure evidence of its breeding in Bulgaria. It is supposed that in the Balkan peninsula in the summer only male and non-multiplying female individuals are found [1]. The species is considered to be migratory but the data about migration routes are few. Nursery colonies are formed most often in holes of trees at the end of April and the beginning of May. The females give birth at the beginning of June: one, sometimes two young.</p>
		<p><b>Similar species.</b> The greater noctule (<i>Nyctalus lasiopterus</i>) and the noctule bat (<i>Nyctalus noctula</i>), from which it differs with the smaller dimensions: the length of the forearm is under 46 mm.</p>
		<p><b>Negative factors.</b> Felling old trees and trees with hollows restricts the possibilities for finding appropriate roosts. In Bulgaria it has been found in owl pellets [3].</p>
		<p><b>Conservation measures taken.</b> The species is protected according to the Biological Diversity Act, EUROBATS and all international conventions (without CITES). One of its localities falls within the reserve Steneto, another is within the territory of the Central Balkans national park. In connection with the monitoring of bat houses, the species is included in the National System for Monitoring the Biological Diversity.</p>
		<p><b>Conservation measures needed.</b> Focused study on the distribution and the biology of the species. Development of a management plan for the forest species of bats.</p>

		<p><b>General distribution.</b> A cosmopolitan species breeding in Asia, Africa, Central and Southern America, Europe (the Pyrenean, the Apennine and the Balkan peninsula, France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany, Austria, Poland, Hungary, Croatia, Moldova, the Ukraine, Southern Russia). It winters in Africa and Southern Asia. The total numbers in Europe, the Eastern Mediterranean (including the Black Sea), are 30 700 – 45 900 breeding pairs [1].</p>
		<p><b>Distribution and abundance in Bulgaria.</b> A breeding summer visitor and passage migrant, it rarely winters. In the past it bred, and still does, along the Danubian and the Black Sea coast, much more rarely within the country to altitudes of up to about 400 m (as an exception up to 550 m) [2, 3]. It has been found in 69 breeding places (9 of which more significant) situated along the Danubian and the Black Sea coast, Northern Bulgaria, the valleys of the rivers Maritsa, Tundzha and Arda [4]. In the second half of the 20th century, the total numbers in the country did not exceed 1 500 pairs [2]. Later it was estimated between 560 and 5 000 [5], 1 000 and 1 500 [6], 1 800 and 2 500 pairs [4, 7].</p>
		<p><b>Habitats.</b> Freshwater lakes and marshes, reservoirs and microreservoirs, fish farms, flooded and flat oak forests close to wetlands of different kinds. During migrations it is also found in shore brackish reservoirs and irrigation canals.</p>
		<p><b>Biology.</b> It mainly breeds in mixed colonies of Egrets, Glossy Ibisses, Spoonbills and Pygmy Cormorants. The nests are located in reedbeds, difficut to access, or on willows and poplars. It breeds 4-5 young ones that start flying from the beginning of July. The food mainly consists of fish, frogs and mice.</p>
		<p><b>Similar species.</b> None.</p>
		<p><b>Negative factors.</b> In the past it was shot down as a pest (in the 1950s). Probably the drying up and the degradation of the wetlands.</p>

		<p><b>General distribution.</b> A species with an unknown type of distribution and a breeding area from the Balkan peninsula (mainly Bulgaria and Romania) in the east to Central Asia and Western China [1].</p>
		<p><b>Distribution and abundance in Bulgaria.</b> A breeding summer visitor and passage migrant, in the past usually in Northeastern Bulgaria. At present it breeds along the Northern Black Sea coast (in the shore stripe, about 1 km wide, between the Golden Sands resort and Durankulak Lake, where the region of cape Kaliakra is among the sites with the highest density of breeding), less often along the Southern Black Sea coast [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]. There are scattered isolated and impermanent breeding places within the country [9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14]. The total numbers in the country are estimated at about 350-500 pairs. It frequently forms hybrids with the <i>Oenanthe hispanica</i> [15, 16, 17, 18] in the valley of the Provadiyska River near Nevsha [19], and in the region of the Yaylata locality, cape Kaliakra, the village of Topola and the Pobitite Kamani locality [D. Georgiev, B. Ivanov, N. Petkov, S. Dereliev, G. Dandlicker – unpublished data].</p>
		<p><b>Habitats.</b> Rocky terrains (often steep sea shores) close to steppe and dry loving herbaceous associations [13].</p>
		<p><b>Biology.</b> It breeds in holes in rocks and soil batters, under stones or in the walls of buildings. It lays 4-5 eggs in May. The female incubates in the course of 13-14 days [15]. The food consists of insects.</p>

		<p><b>Conservation status:</b> <i>in Bulgaria:</i>
			<b>Vulnerable VU</b> [B2a], BDA-III; <i>International:</i> BeC-II, HD-IV.</p>
		<p><b>General distribution.</b> The Balkan peninsula: Greece (the prov. Evros, Xanthi, Drama, all eastern Aegean islands, Thassos and Karpathos), Bulgaria (the eastern parts of the Eastern Rhodopes), European Turkey, Asia Minor (without the Black Sea coast and the neighbouring regions), Cyprus, the countries beyond the Caucasus Mountains (Eastern Georgia, Armenia, Azerbaijan), Russia (Checheno-Ingushetia, Dagestan), the Eastern Mediterranean, in the east to Pakistan; Northern Africa in the west to Algeria.</p>
		<p><b>Distribution and abundance in Bulgaria.</b> The far border regions in the Eastern Rhodopes in two habitats isolated one from the other: around the village of Mezek [1, 2, 3] and the valley of the river Byala reka to the east of the village of Meden buk [2, 4]. In the region of the village of Mandritsa in 1979 up to 10-15 individuals could be observed within an hour [5], and in 2001 4-6 individuals in a 50 meter transect [4]. In the region above the village of Mezek in 2004 the species had average numbers in transects 100 / 5 m – up to 8,2 individuals [3]. The habitat immediately near the village of Mezek is probably destroyed because of forestation with black pine of the slopes near the village [4]; the species is found over this belt to the ridge parts of the Gorata hill [3].</p>
		<p><b>Habitats.</b> In the region of the river Byala reka it is found at altitudes of up to about 200-250 m, whereas over the village of Mezek at altitudes from 300 to 650 m [3]. It is found in dry terrains overgrown with xerothermic grasses and shrubs and sticks to stony and rocky terrains, screes, steep slopes over roads, ravines, quarries, etc. [6].</p>
		<p><b>Biology.</b> The species is markedly warmth-loving. It remains active even in the hottest hours of the day in the summer season, when the other lizards are resting. It moves extremely fast. Copulation is in May. It lays 2-6 eggs until the middle of July. It feeds on small invertebrates.</p>
		<p><b>Similar species.</b> It differs from the other species of the Lacertidae family with the lack of an eyelid and the larger, slightly pointed and not grainy scales on the back.</p>
		<p><b>Negative factors.</b> A proved negative factor is reforestation with coniferous wood species (black pine), which is the reason for the disappearance from the habitat of the species immediately near the village of Mezek. Understudied is the effect of fires. Preliminary data show that it successfully occupies burnt down regions (in the areas of the villages Meden buk, Dolno Lukovo and Mandritsa).</p>
		<p><b>Conservation measures taken.</b> Included in the Bulgarian Red Data Book, 1985, in the category <i>rare</i>. Its habitats are in the <i>Natura 2000</i> network of protected territories. It has been portrayed on a poster for the protection of reptiles (1998).</p>

		<p><b>General distribution.</b> A species with a trans-Palearctic range (from Portugal to Northeastern China). In Europe it breeds in Portugal, Spain, Germany, Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Austria, Hungary, Serbia, Moldova, the Ukraine and Southwestern Russia. In the last 100-150 years, with the increase of arable lands, it partially expanded its area.</p>
		<p><b>Distribution and abundance in Bulgaria.</b> At the end of the 19th century it was reported breeding everywhere; later it was found only in the village of Zlatiyata, in Dobrudzha and in the Varna region [1, 2, 3]. At present it is probably extinct as a breeding species. The last two unconfirmed observations of breeding birds are from the middle of the 1990s: in the village of Zlatiyata and near the village of Bezvoditsa, Dobrich region. After 1990 it was observed only in the winter.</p>
		<p><b>Habitats.</b> Arable lands and pastures. In the breeding period it settles in varies open steppe landscapes, virgin-land steppes with rich herbaceous vegetation, mainly in the Spear-grass steppe [4].</p>
		<p><b>Biology.</b> It breeds in various steppe microhabitats: ploughed fields with Rye, hilly forest-free Spear-grass steppes (black earth and clay). It lays 1-10 eggs at the beginning of June. In the last decades the average number of eggs in the whole area of the species decreased from 4 to 2. The young ones hatch in July and remain for a long time with the female. The choice of the breeding area is connected not so much with the nature of the microhabitats as with the presence of animal food in the vicinity, necessary for the young ones at their early age. [7]. It depends on the closeness of the formicaries and their number, because ant eggs are the basic food of the chicks and the young birds. The newly hatched young ones do not have great mobility and their feeding area is limited.</p>
		<p><b>Similar species.</b> The Little Bustard (<i>Tetrax tetrax</i>).</p>
		<p><b>Negative factors.</b> Destruction and change of the habitats and their transformation into lands for agriculture and forestry. Illegal shooting, chemical pollution, disturbance.</p>
		<p><b>Conservation measures taken.</b> A protected species, included in the Red Data Book of Bulgaria (1985). One of its last habitats is declared Protected Territory.</p>
		<p><b>Conservation measures needed.</b> Development of a National Plan for its conservation, with a long-term programme for artificial breeding and permanent settlement in appropriate habitats; a large campaign among the local population for popularizing its significance and its conservation; studies of the closeness of the Bulgarian population with the rest of the Central European bustards; creation of a large reserve in the steppe regions of Northeastern Bulgaria.</p>

		<p><b>Distribution and abundance in Bulgaria.</b> Found only in the southwesternmost regions of the country: Kresna Gorge (D.W. Wrase, personal communication) and Kozhuh Hill in the Sandanski-Petrich Kettle [1]. In the last 15 years, not more than 15 specimens were collected or observed in Bulgaria, almost all of them recorded on the western slope of Kozhuh. On the basis of investigations, the numbers of that population are estimated at not more than 300-400 adult specimens.</p>
		<p><b>Habitats.</b> A xerophilous species. It inhabits open stone-grass xerophytic plant formations of the Mediterranean or Submediterranean type with altitudes of up to 250-300 m. This species lives in the soil at depths between 20 and 40 cm.</p>
		<p><b>Biology.</b> The adult is a geophile. It digs vertical or semivertical tunnels in the soil, also using natural cavities between larger and deeply dug-in stones. On their bottoms it builds a chamber for every egg, in which it stores immature plant seeds to be used as food by the newly hatched larva. At sunset or during the night, the adult climbs onto the stems of plants. The larva and the adult are phytophagous and feed on seeds of plants, mainly of the family of aster (Asteraceae). There is no information on reproduction but on the basis of the biology of closely related species a small number of eggs, care of the offspring and a limited number of specimens are supposed.</p>

		<p><b>General distribution.</b> A cosmopolitan monotypical species. It breeds in Europe, Asia, America, Northern Africa, Australia. The northern populations are migratory.</p>
		<p><b>Distribution and abundance in Bulgaria.</b> A breeding summer visitor and passage migrant. In the past, 31 habitats were known from the breeding period, whereby a total of about 10-20 pairs "remained" in the country [1, 5]. Today it is found in a restricted and non-permanent number of habitats. There are data about 3 cases of certain breeding (Ivaylovgrad Reservoir, Pyasachnik Reservoir, Aleko Konstantinovo fish arms) [2] and 5 of very probable breeding (near the village of Hadzhidimovo, a microreservoir near the village of Brezovo, Plovdiv region, Asenovtsi Reservoir, Sliven region, Ticha Reservoir [2] and Belene Island [3]. The total abundance of the species in the country is estimated at 3-6 [2], and 10 breeding pairs [5].</p>
		<p><b>Habitats.</b> Various natural and artificial wetlands with stagnant or flowing waters. A basic requirement with respect to the habitat is the presence of considerable food resources (mainly fish) in combination with appropriate places for breeding (old trees in flooded forests, poles of power lines, etc.). When looking for food it goes away at distances of up to 10-20 km [4].</p>
		<p><b>Biology.</b> In Bulgaria it is unstudied. Breeding starts at the age of 3-6 years. It nests singularly, mainly using trees, in some cases rocks and artificial facilities (including poles of high-voltage lines). It lays 2-3 eggs from the second half of April to the beginning of May. The incubation period is 34-40 days. Until the autumn migration, the young birds are bound to the adults. It migrates on a large scale. It feeds exclusively on fish [4].</p>
		<p><b>Similar species.</b> None.</p>
		<p><b>Negative factors.</b> Destruction and/or degradation of habitats; poaching, illegal shooting during migration and the breeding period (in fish farms); disturbance by fishermen, hunters, tourists, etc. (it is especially sensitive to human presence); reduction of the fish reserves (in the larger water basins in the country); felling of old trees near the water basins. A great risk of collisions and/or shortcuts with high voltage power lines.</p>
		<p><b>Conservation measures taken.</b> Protected according to the Biological Diversity Act, included in the Red Data Book of Bulgaria (1985); some of its habitats (Belene Island) fall withing protected territories.</p>
		<p><b>Conservation measures needed.</b> Determination of certain habitats; guarding of vulnerable nests during the breeding season; declaring the places with certain breeding habitats protected; increase of the ecological culture of the population. Attraction by artificial nests to places that are suitable for the species. Improvement of the effectiveness of the nature protection legislation by a considerable increase of the size of the sanctions.</p>

		<p><b>Distribution and abundance in Bulgaria.</b> It was found in Bulgaria many times in large numbers in the Danube. It is known from 25 localities in the Bulgarian section from Novo Selo to Silistra [1]. It used to occurr in large subpopulations until 1968 [1]. After that it was not found there [2, 3]. Finding of adults near a canal close to Maritsa River near Plovdiv in 1956 and 1958 was also reported [4].</p>
		<p><b>Habitats.</b> The nymphs are typical inhabitants of the clay substrate in the large European rivers [5].</p>
		<p><b>Biology.</b> <i>Palingenia longicauda</i> is the largest mayfly in Europe. The nymph is of the "burrowing" type, inhabiting U-shaped holes with a depth of about 25 cm. The mouthparts and the forelegs of the nymph are adapted to burrowing in the clay [6]. The last instar nymphs leave the holes, swim out onto the surface and develop: the females into adults [7] and the males into subimagines and then into adults. They emerge usually in June, between 4 and 6 p.m. Mating takes place during the half-hour "mass flight", characteristic of this species. Then the males fall into the water, and the fertilized females fly against the current at a speed of about 18 km/h, doing a "compensation flight before egg laying" [8]. The female lays 8 000 – 9 000 eggs that, because of their slow sinking and the speed of the current in the rivers, are driven down many kilometres along the current [1]. Only those eggs develop that fell onto a clay substrate. The larvae hatch in 4-6 weeks and in the course of three years undergo about 20 moultings [9]. They feed on organic matter that they assimilate from the clay consumed [9, 10].</p>
		<p><b>Similar species.</b> <i>Ephoron virgo</i>. It differs by the shape of the elongation of the mandibula, which in <i>Palingenia longicauda</i> is fan-like, with strong chitin teeth, located laterally.</p>

		<p><b>General distribution.</b> A species with a European type of distribution. It breeds in Western Siberia, Asia Minor and Europe (without the northernmost and northwesternmost regions and the vast forestless valleys). It winters in Africa, to the south of Sahara.</p>
		<p><b>Distribution and abundance in Bulgaria.</b> A breeding summer visitor<b>, </b>widely distributed in the past [1]. At the beginning of the 1980s, the numbers were estimated at 200 – 350 pairs [2]. It is common in the Eastern Balkan range, the mountains Strandzha and Eastern Rhodopes; in the valleys it is less frequent. In the habitats registered so far, the forest territory inhabited is about 20 – 25 000 km2 [3]. At a density of 1 pair per 50-100 km2, the numbers are most probably 300-400 breeding pairs. Other estimates give 150-300 [4] and even 750 – 900 pairs [5]. The tendency in the dynamic of the population in the last 40-45 years has not been clarified.</p>
		<p><b>Habitats.</b> It prefers high-stem deciduous forests but it also breeds in mixed and coniferous forests at altitudes of up to 1 600 – 1 700 m in the vicinity of open spaces. Numerous during migration along the Black Sea coast, especially at the end of the August and the beginning of September [6].</p>
		<p><b>Biology.</b> The pairs occupy the breeding territories in April. It breeds only on trees, at a height of 10-22 m, or uses the nests of other birds of prey. In April-May it lays 2, very rarely 1, 3 or 4 eggs. Incubation continues for 28 – 35 days, and the young ones remain in the nest for 40 – 45 days [2; 7]. A family with 4 young that left their nests was observed on 29 June 2002 near the village of Bunovo, Sofia region. It mainly feeds on larvae of bumble bees and bees, hornets and other insects, small birds, reptiles and rodents. The breeding area is over 1 000 ha, but it looks for food up to 7 km away from the nest [8]. In comparison with the other birds of prey, it spends comparatively little time in Bulgaria and as early as in August it starts flying away to the south. Singuar birds have been observed in December.</p>

		<p><b>General distribution.</b> Europe and Asia in the basins of the Black Sea, the Sea of Azov and the Sea of Marmara. It is also found in the basins of the rivers Struma and Maritsa flowing into the Aegean Sea. Its occurrence is reported in Byelorussia, Bulgaria, Georgia, Greece, Moldova, Romania, Russia, the Ukraine and Turkey.</p>
		<p><b>Distribution and abundance in Bulgaria.</b> It was first recorded in the rivers Kamchiya, Veleka and Poturnashka [1]. Later, it was recorded in most of the other Black Sea rivers: Batova, Devnya, Provadiyska, Perperek, Ropotamo, Dyavolska and Rezovska [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]. It was also found in some water bodies affiliated to the Aegean Sea basin: the Mochuritsa River, a tributary of the Tundzha River [9, 10], and in a small marsh within the Struma River basin [11]. A comparatively rare species. Although it was found in many habitats, its populations are extremely vulnerable. The species is extinct in some of its former habitats, such as the Mochurishta River [12]. In the Provadiyska River, it was not recorded as early as during the ichthyological investigations in the 1970s, and now it is considered extinct [13]. Recently, it has been confirmed in some of the southern Black Sea rivers [14, 15, 16]. At present, the only habitat of the species in the Aegean Sea basin is the canal passing through the Protected area "Rupite" and flowing into the Struma River [13].</p>
		<p><b>Habitats.</b> It inhabits slow-flowing rivers overgrown with macrophytic vegetation. It is also found in standing waters with a high degree of eutrophication, and in estuaries.</p>
		<p><b>Biology.</b> It reaches sexual maturity at the age of 3-4 years. Spawning occurs in the period April-May. Females release about 2 500 eggs at average. It feeds on invertebrate animals, small fish and fish eggs [13].</p>
		<p><b>Similar species.</b> The European chub (<i>Leuciscus cephalus</i>), from which it is distinguished most easily by the lower number of scales in the lateral line – 35-40 (in the European chub they are 43-47).</p>

		<p><b>General distribution.</b> A Sarmatian species. It breeds on the Balkan peninsula, along the eastern shore of the Black Sea, the coasts of the Sea of Azov, the Caspian Sea and the Aral Sea, Balkhash Lake, Kazakhstan, Mongolia, Northern China. The total abundance in the region of the Black Sea and the Mediterranean is 2 300 – 3 200 individuals [1].</p>
		<p><b>Distribution and abundance in Bulgaria.</b> A breeding summer visitor, a passage migrant and partly winter visitor. In the past, there were breeding colonies along the banks of the Danube and the Black Sea and in the Straldzha Marsh [2]. Since the middle of the 20th century it has been breeding only in Srebarna Lake (in the period 1954-2005 there were between 29 and 128 pairs, 67 at the average). During the migration and in the winter it is found along the Black Sea coast, less frequently within the country. In the region of Burgas Bay between 10 August and 30 October, 226 migrating birds have been registered at the average [3, 4]. In the winter, it has been registered in largest numbers in the Burgas lakes (Mandrensko Ezero – 420 individuals in January 1997, and Vaya – 323 individuals in January 1999) [5, 6].</p>
		<p><b>Habitats.</b> Freshwater lakes and marshes, reservoirs and microreservoirs and fish farms; during migrations and wintering – mainly coast brackish water basins, and non-freezing reservoirs within the country.</p>
		<p><b>Biology.</b> It breeds in lakes and marshes with vast reedbeds, difficult to access, usually from the beginning of February. When looking for food, adult birds fly up to 20-30 km away from the breeding colonies. The clutch consists of 1-5 eggs. The young ones start flying in July-August. The breeding success in Srebarna is 0,84 young/breeding pair at the average; [7]. It feeds exclusively on fish.</p>
		<p><b>Similar species.</b> The White Pelican (<i>Pelecanus onocrotalus</i>).</p>
		<p><b>Negative factors.</b> In the breeding places: threat of predators and wild boars, persecution (in the past), fires in the reedbeds, extremely low temperatures, violation of the integrity of the breeding places as a result of an inordinarily high water level. During migration and wintering: clashing into electric power cables [8], shooting [9], soiling the feathers with black oil.</p>
		<p><b>Conservation measures taken.</b> A protected species as of 1962; included in the Red Data Book of Bulgaria (1985); an international plan has been prepared for its conservation, there is a good level of information of the population, monitoring and studies on its biology and ecology are being carried out, a plan for the management of the Srebarna reserve has been prepared [10].</p>

			<b>Vulnerable VU</b> [D2], BDA-III; <i>International:</i> BD-I.</p>
		<p><b>General distribution.</b> A species with a North Atlantic type of distribution that embraces the Atlantic coast of Europe and Northwestern Africa and the coasts of the Mediterranean, the Adriatic Sea and the Black Sea.</p>
		<p><b>Distribution and abundance in Bulgaria.</b> Resident. It breeds along the rocky shore from cape Shabla to cape Kaliakra [1, 2], without any essential changes having been registered in the breeding area. In 1985, the numbers of the breeding population were about 25-30 [1]; in 1992 they were 50, in 1993 they were 62, in 1995 more than 80 pairs [3]; in 1997 the estimate was 10-50 pairs [4], and at present it is about 130-170 pairs [5], and even 180-250 pairs [6]. It is possible for the latter estimate to have been exaggerated. There is, however, a slow increase of the numbers and the population ought to be considered stable. In the winter, the species stays in the same area or goes down south, almost along the whole Bulgarian shore [2, 7]. The average numbers of wintering birds for the 1977-1996 period was 28 (3-74) individuals, with a maximum of 74 in 1990. Most of the individuals (75%) remain along the shore of Southern Dobrudzha [7]. Although the breeding population is considered to be residential, winter migrations have not been not well clarified. Outside the breeding period, large concentrations are observed at a considerable distance from the breeding sites [3].</p>
		<p><b>Habitats.</b> Vertical shore rocks with holes and caves, shore lakes, mouths of rivers, etc.</p>
		<p><b>Biology.</b> It breeds singularly or in small groups in shore caves and rock niches. Laying eggs starts probably at the beginning of April to the middle of the month. The clutch contains 3-6 white eggs. The breeding success is 0,34-0,4 young ones/pair [8]; it has been higher in recent years, ensuring the slow increase of the population. It feeds mainly on small fish (predominantly tadpoles) and crustaceans [2, 8].</p>

		<p><b>Distribution and abundance in Bulgaria.</b> Resident. Until the end of the 19th century usually in Southeastern Bulgaria between the lower reaches of the river Maritsa and the Black Sea. Until about 1880 in the Aytos area of the Balkan Mountains, in Sakar and the Sliven field, until the 1930s in Strandzha and the regions of Elhovo, Burgas, Yambol, Sliven, Petrich, Pomorie, Svilengrad, near the village of Trankovo, in the regions of Karnobat, Vidin, Kubrat, Razgrad, near the Batova River and in the Petrich region [1, 2]. After 1950, only in the lower reaches of the river Tundzha, and about 1980 only in the Dolna Topchiya reserve near Elhovo [1, 3]. At the end of the 1950s, it could probably be observed in the Krusharska grove near the village of Hadzhi Dimitar, in Gorna Topchiya near the village of Konevets, in Dolna Topchiya near Elhovo and near the village of Vinitsa at Parvomay, and in the Azmaka River near the Ormana locality at Yambol it already had hybrid signs [4]. Until the 1960s, only in singular places in the regions of Stara Zagora, Yambol, Elhovo and Parvomay [1, 2]. In the 1990s it diseappeared in Bulgaria (and thus also in the whole of Europe to the west of the Black Sea). In 1980-1990, all individuals from the valley of the river Tundzha had hybrid signs [5, 6]. The numbers in Bulgaria are unknown.</p>

		<p><b><i>Phocoena phocoena</i> (Linnaeus, 1758)</b></p>
		<p><i>Phocaena communis</i> Cuv.: Kovachev, 1925: 7-8.</p>
		<p>Order Cetacea</p>
		<p>Family Phocoenidae</p>
		<p><b>Conservation status:</b> <i> in Bulgaria</i>: <b>Vulnerable VU </b>[A1acde + 2ce], BDA; <i>International:</i> IUCN-VU, BeC; BoC, HD.</p>
		<p><b>General distribution.</b> The coastal regions of the Arctic Ocean, the coasts of the northern parts of the Atlantic and the Pacific Ocean, the Mediterranean (including the Aegean Sea), the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov (the Black Sea individuals are smaller than the Mediterranean ones and represent a genetically independent population [1].</p>
		<p><b>Distribution and abundance in Bulgaria.</b> The coastal Black Sea waters. The data are rather scarce. More systemic observations were made along the northern coast – cape Emine, Galata, Zelenka, Duran-Kulak, etc. The numbers are understudied, with a tendency for a decrease. In 1967-1971 the Black Sea population numbered, according to some observations, about 18 300 individuals, and the species had much less numbers than the common dolphin. In the 1992-1995 period, from cape Galata to cape Emine only about 20 individuals were counted every year [2].</p>
		<p><b>Habitats.</b> The coasts, most often up to 2-3 sea miles from the shore (at depths of 30 – 35 m) [2].</p>
		<p><b>Biology.</b> It lives in small groups (4-6 individuals at the average). Larger groups are formed in mass gatherings of fish. It swims slowly, near the surface, rarely jumping over the water [3; 4; 2]. Food: mainly fish (predominantly benthic; in the spring and in the autumn also shoal, pelagic fish); also crayfish, molluscs, even algae. Mating season from June to September, giving birth (1 young) in May-August, preganancy lasts 11 months [5].</p>
		<p><b>Similar species.</b> It differs from the other two Black Sea dolphins, the common dolphin and the bottle-nosed dolphin, by the lack of a fold between the upper jaw and the frontal region; the small size (140 cm at the average); the low, triangular back fin.</p>
		<p><b>Negative factors.</b> Until 1983, industrial dolphin fishing. Nowdays, the abrupt worsening of the habitats (pollution of the coastal waters), the reduction of the nutrition base, the stationary fishing with modern synthetic nets, very robust and transparent (invisible for the dolphin): carcasses of dolphins washed ashore and suffocated were systematically observed in the last years along the coast between Kavarna – Durankulak and Pomorie – Sinemorets [6].</p>
		<p><b>Conservation measures taken.</b> Protected by the Biological Diversity Act. Included in the Bulgarian Red Data Book of 1985.</p>
		<p><b>Conservation measures needed.</b> Monitoring and study of the biology of the species in the Black Sea and of the causes for its declining. Control of coastal pollution and of the methods of coastal fishing.</p>

		<p><b><i>Phoenicurus phoenicurus</i> (Linnaeus, 1758)</b></p>
		<p>Order Passeriformes</p>
		<p>Family Muscicapidae</p>
		<p><b>Conservation status:</b> <i>in Bulgaria:</i>
			<b>Vulnerable VU </b>C, BDA-II;<i> International: </i>ESC-Spec 2, BeC-II, BoC-II.</p>
		<p><b>General distribution.</b> A Palearctic species, over 50% of its area is in Europe. It winters in the region of Sahara.</p>
		<p><b>Distribution and abundance in Bulgaria.</b> A breeding summer visitor and passage migrant. In the past it was rare, with few established habitats to the south of the Balkan range [1]. At present, there are unconfirmed localiies in the mountains Vitosha and Lyulin, around the towns of Roman, Svoge, Berkovitsa, Zemen, Troyan, Svishtov, Balchik, the villages of Churicheni, Krupnik, Gurkovo, the river Kamchiya, the huts Barikadite and Partizanska [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11]. Today found in mountainous and low mountainous regions (Strandha, Vitosha, the Rila-Rhodope massif, Osogovska Planina, Etropolska Planina, Dragoevska Planina, the Balkan range, the plateaus Frangensko and Momino), less often in the valleys (along the Danube and the Black Sea coast) [12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17]. Breeding in Bulgaria are 2 000 – 6 000 pairs, of the subspecies <i>Ph. ph. phoenicurus</i> and <i>Ph. ph. samamisicus</i>, the latter having been registered only along the Black Sea coast and in Strandzha mountain.</p>
		<p><b>Habitats.</b> Deciduous, mixed and riverside forests, parks, gardens and human settlements. Rarely in coniferous forests [18, 19] and rock habitats [6, 20].</p>
		<p><b>Biology.</b> It breeds in the hollows of trees, holes in walls and buildings [21, 22], rarely in rock cracks and niches, old nests of swallows [6; 20]. In other parts of the area it breeds in the roots of trees and along screes. It mainly feeds on insects (butterflies, beetles) and spiders and in the autumn also on small fruits [23].</p>
		<p><b>Similar species.</b> <i>Phoenicurus ochruros </i>(L. 1758)</p>
		<p><b>Negative factors.</b> Destruction of forest habitats and trees with hollows, increase of the inter-species competition [24, 25]. In Southern Europe, the decrease of the numbers is probably also due to the low breeding productivity [26].</p>
		<p><b>Conservation measures taken.</b> Protected according to the Biological Diversity Act. A small part of the population inhabits Protected Territories.</p>
		<p><b>Conservation measures needed.</b> Study of the distribution, the numbers, the biology and the ecology, aimed at particularizing the threats. Limitation of felling in places with a high density of the species. Placing houses at sites with declining numbers.</p>

		<p><b>General distribution.</b> A Sarmatian species with a restricted area in the southeastern parts of the Western Palearctic. [1, 2]. In Europe 37 323 pairs breed (75% of the world population) [3].</p>
		<p><b>Distribution and abundance in Bulgaria.</b> A breeding summer visitor, wintering with isolated breeding habitats along the Danube and the Black Sea coast. In the past it mainly bred along the Danube valley and the Black Sea coast [13, 14, 15, 16]. It was found incubating in Mandrensko Ezero lake [17] and in Burgas Lake [18]. At present it breeds on the Danube islands Malak bliznak, Tsibar, Kalnovats, Mishka and Bezimen, where 6 colonies have been found (73 pairs) [4]. The most stable habitat is Srebarna Lake with 147 pairs at the average [5]. It breeds very rarely along the Maritsa River [6, 7, 8]. The total numbers are between 100 and 500 pairs [8, 9, 10, 11]. Until the 1980s, Bulgaria was in the periphery of the winter area and the numbers of the wintering birds were under 500 individuals. In 1982-84, its shift to the Balkan peninsula started, with the valley of the Maritsa River as a centre: 5 030 and 6 950 wintering individuals [10]. In 1997 the formation of a new wintering site started in the region of the Burgas lakes: 6 850 individuals in 2000 [12]. In the 1995-2000 period, the average winter numbers varied from 7 000 to 13 000 individuals.</p>
		<p><b>Habitats.</b> Flooded island forests in the valleys of the Danube and the Maritsa, large reedbeds in Danubian and Black Sea lakes.</p>
		<p><b>Biology.</b> It breeds in mixed colonies together with large cormorants, egrets, glossy ibisses and spoonbills on white poplars, willows or amongst reed. It lays 2-5 eggs, the young ones leave the nests in July. Fish-eating.</p>
		<p><b>Similar species.</b> None.</p>
		<p><b>Negative factors.</b> Destruction and degradation of habitats in the valleys of the Danube and the Maritsa; direct killing in the region of the wintering sites in the valley of the Maritsa; disturbance during the breeding period.</p>
		<p><b>Conservation measures taken.</b> Protected according to the Biological Diversity Act. Included in the Red Data Book of Bulgaria (1985). A plan for its preservation has been prepared [10]; proposals have been submitted for the places for spending nights during the winter along the valley of the Maritsa to be declared Protected Territories; some of the habitats are included in the indicative list of Protected Zones according to the Biological Diversity Act (<i>Natura 2000</i>); the largest sites for spending nights in the winter are guarded by volunteers.</p>
		<p><b>Conservation measures needed.</b> Measures must be envisioned in the Management Plans of the <i>Natura 2000</i> territories against killing and disturbance of wintering birds [10]. </p>

		<p><b>General distribution.</b> A Palearctic species inhabiting Central, Eastern and Southeastern Asia; the zone of deciduous forests in Eastern, Northern, Central, Southeastern Europe and France. A glacial relict that inhabited Europe in historical time.</p>
		<p><b>Distribution and abundance in Bulgaria.</b> Resident, common until the 1950s [1; 2]. It breeds in the mountainous, less often in valley forests [3; 4; 5; 6]. breeding territories near the Danube probably embrace also the Romanian bank, that has more forests. Its numbers sharply declined in the Ludogorie region, the mountains Central Balkans, Rila and elsewhere, where it was common [3; 7; 8; 9]. With an average density of 500 – 1 000 ha/1 pairs, the numbers are 1 000 – 1 800 pairs. There are similar data for central Europe and Russia [5; 6; 10].</p>
		<p><b>Habitats.</b> Primary beech and oak forests up to 1 000 – 1 200 m, dense forests [4; 5; 6; 8; 9; 12; 13; 14; 15; 16]. Secondarily riverside and other forests with old trees, town parks, orchards. Outside the breeding period it is found as far as the upper border of the forests [6; Spiridonov, unpublished data].</p>
		<p><b>Biology.</b> The breeding chamber is in a trunk with a diameter over 35 cm and at a height of 0,85-15 m. Formation of the pairs, multiplication and breeding the young ones is from March to the middle of June. There are clutches from the end of April to the beginning of June (5-9 eggs), it incubates for 17-18 days, the young ones fly away 24-31 days after hatching; in the Ludogorie region there were two young ones that left the nest: on 31 May and 17 June [6; 8; 10; 11]. Trophically it depends on the abundance of ants and during the winter on insects-xylophages and their larvae; it also visits the bird houses [5; 6]. It is attached to the breeding regions. The territories of the pairs in old and forests rich in ants is most often 200-400 ha [5; 6; 8; 10; 12].</p>
		<p><b>Similar species.</b> None.</p>
		<p><b>Negative factors.</b> A severe reduction of the area of old forests in the last 50 years, foresting coniferous cultures and sanitary felling. Illegal felling in the valleys and the low mountainous belt in the last 15 years. Decrease of the trophic base. Narrow specialization towards food and habitat. Competition by the black – and especially the green woodpecker, better specialized in hunting ants on the ground [5; 6].</p>
		<p><b>Conservation measures taken.</b> The species and its habitats are protected according to the Biological Diversity Act. Strandzha mountain has been declared Natural Park.</p>
		<p><b>Conservation measures needed.</b> Declaration of protected territories and zones in the Balkan range, in the mountains Sredna Gora and Pirin and in the Ludogorie region. A moratorium on the use of forests in the closed basins and protected territories; outside them, by restoration fellings should be left 25-30 old trees per ha undisturbed.

		<p><b>General distribution.</b> A Siberian-Canadian species with a breeding area including the taiga of Europe, Asia and North America. The subspecies <i>P. t. alpinus</i> is a glacial relict found in the mountains of Central and Southeastern Europe, including the Balkan peninsula, where two meta-populations survived with small numbers.</p>
		<p><b>Distribution and abundance in Bulgaria.</b> Resident. At the beginning of the 20th century it was considered common at some places in the Rila mountain, but until the end of the century it remained understudied and with few registered breeding places in the mountains Rila, Pirin and the Western Rhodopes [1, 2,3]. In 1995-2005, it was found in more places in the three mountains [4]; Recently it was registered also in the reserves Mantaritsa and Soskovcheto and above Prespa Hut, in the Western Rhodopes (T. Zlatanov, P. Shurulinkov, unpublished information). Numbers: 90-130 breeding pairs; of the Rilo-Rhodope meta-population common for Bulgaria and Greece – 140-230 pairs, of the Western Balkan one – 80 – 290 pairs [5].</p>
		<p><b>Habitats.</b> Old coniferous, mainly spruce forests with more dying trees, most frequently at altitudes between 1 400 and 1 800 m.</p>
		<p><b>Biology.</b> In Central Europe incubation (usually 3-5 eggs) is from the middle of May to the beginning of June, lasting for 14 days. [6]. In Pirin, feeding the young is at the beginning of June and flying away from the nest at the end of the month [3]; 95% of the food consists of insects – xylophages and their larvae, found in dying trees with slightly falling-off bark and soft wood [7,8]. In Central Europe it breeds in old natural, mainly spruce forests; the breeding and winter territories are from 40 to 230 ha [8, 9, 10; Z. Spiridonov, L. Mileva, unpublished information)].</p>

		<p><b>General distribution.</b> In Europe – only along the Bulgarian Black Sea shore between Sozopol and Ahtopol, probably also around Istanbul; in Asia – sporadically in Northwestern and Southern Asia Minor and along the eastern coasts of the Mediterranean and Jordan. In Bulgaria, the subspecies <i>Platyceps collaris thracius</i> is found, along the Bulgarian Southern Black Sea shore [1].</p>
		<p><b>Distribution and abundance in Bulgaria.</b> The species was registered in Bulgaria in 1979 [2]. Only 8 habitats are known, with total numbers up to several hundreds of individuals. The habitats are isolated between each other. They are situated at 0,2 – 10 km from the sea shore, at altitudes of 10 – 100 m. The most northwestern one is in the region of Sozopol, the most southeastern one near Ahtopol [2, 3, 4, 5]. There are no reports on its distribution and numbers in the past. Two of the 8 known habitats were found after 2000.</p>
		<p><b>Habitats.</b> It inhabits stony places overgrown with herbaceous and short bushes. For shelter it uses rock cracks leading into the depth, piles of stones, etc. [6].</p>
		<p><b>Biology.</b> Multiplication in Bulgaria has not been studied. An egg-laying species. In the middle of July it lays 3 – 6 eggs sized 24,9 – 29,6 x 8,1 – 8,5 mm [5]. It probably feeds on small lizards (<i>Ablepharus, Lacerta, Podarcis</i>), etc. It is not poisonous. It rarely reaches a length of 1 m.</p>

		<p>Order Grasshoppers and crickets (Orthoptera)</p>
		<p>Family Short-horned grasshoppers (Acrididae)</p>
		<p><b>Conservation status:</b> <i>in Bulgaria</i>: <b>Critically endangered CR </b>[B2ab(ii)c(ii)].</p>
		<p><b>General distribution.</b> The Aegean Sea coast of Northern Greece; the Black Sea coast of Bulgaria, the Ukraine and Russia; Moldova and the Caspian Sea coast of Russia to the delta of the Volga river.</p>
		<p><b>Distribution and abundance in Bulgaria.</b> Found in a locality restricted in its area near the mouth of the Ropotamo River (1958, 1961, 1962, 1963 and 1967) [1, 2, 3]. Later it was not found. Considerable fluctuations in the population abundance were observed, with tendencies for a decline: high in 1958, very low in 1961, low in 1962-1967 [2, 3].</p>
		<p><b>Habitats.</b> A halophylic mesohygrobiotic and euryhygrophilic species. It inhabits sunlit, entirely open salty sandy terrains, partly flooded by sea water, without herbaceous vegetation or with a low one, very thinned, with a predomination of <i>Artemisia santonicum</i> along the low riverbanks near the sea shore [1].</p>
		<p><b>Biology.</b> In Bulgaria, adults are found in July and August but in other parts of the range they have been recorded from June to September [4]. The eggs overwinter in soil, laid in groups in "cocoons", and hatch at the end of April or in May. Because of the strong requirements of the species of salty soils along the sea shore, its food mainly contains herbaceous halophilic plants. It keeps to the soil. In 1958, the only year when a high abundance of the population was observed, the specimens moved in groups displaying a gregarious behaviour [1].</p>
		<p><b>Similar species.</b> None.</p>
		<p><b>Negative factors.</b> Tourist infrastructure and intensive development of tourism in the region between Sozopol and Primorsko are the major factors restricting the area of the typical habitat of <i>Platypygius crassus</i>.</p>
		<p><b>Conservation measures taken.</b> The habitat is included in the Ropotamo Reserve.</p>
		<p><b>Conservation measures needed.</b> Study of the current state of the population, aimed at determining concrete measures for conservation. Ban on activities around the mouth of Ropotamo that disturb the normal ecological parameters of the habitat.</p>

		<p><b>General distribution.</b> An Old World species. It breeds in a scattered fashion in Western and Central Europe, the southern half of the territory of Russia, Byelorussia, the Ukraine, Romania, Western Siberia, Kazakhstan, Mongolia, the Far East, Northeastern China, Asia Ninor, Iran, Iraq and Pakistan; in Africa – Kenia, Tansania and South Africa; the western parts of Northern America.</p>
		<p><b>Distribution and abundance in Bulgaria.</b> A rarely breeding summer visitor, a mainly passage migrant and wintering species. In the past, it mainly inhabited the larger marshes along the Danube and the Burgas Lakes [1, 2]. At present, singular pairs breed irregularly in the Srebarna reserve [3] and in the Kalimok fish farms near Tutrakan. The population abundance in the country does not exceed 40 breeding pairs. During migration it is found in the larger water basins in the whole country. It winters mainly along the Black Sea coast and the lakes near the shore, less frequently in the internal water basins of the country [2, 4]. For the period 1977-1996, the average numbers of wintering birds were 1 573 (517-3049) individuals, with a maximum in 1994; after 1996 the average numbers slightly increased and reached 2 130 individuals; the largest abundance was registered in Varna Lake – 1 030 individuals in the winter of 1998 [4].</p>
		<p><b>Habitats.</b> In the breeding period it prefers large freshwater lakes, fish farms with large separate basins, richly overgrown with vegetation, on which it builds its nests. In the winter it is close to the sea shore and in the shore lakes, less frequently in large, non-freezing freshwater basins, reservoirs, etc.</p>
		<p><b>Biology.</b> It breeds in colonies different in size; less often singularly. It usually forms mixed colonies with the Whiskered Tern. It builds a floating nest on the open water surface or on the overgrowth of Fringed Water-lily and Water Chestnut. It lays in May. The clutch contains 3-8 elongated white eggs. The young ones are nidifugous. After hatching the family resettles in another part of the water basin. The young ones become independent at the age of about 3 weeks [2]. Food: small fish, crustaceans, mussels, water plants, water insects and their larvae.</p>
		<p><b>Similar species.</b> The Slavonian Grebe (<i>Podiceps auritus</i>)<i>.</i>
		</p>
		<p><b>Negative factors.</b> The abandoning of the existing fish farms along the Danube. The bad management and the impermanent water regime in the reserves Belene and Srebarna; the loss of the major microhabitat in the marshes of Belene – overgrowths with Fringed Water-lily and Water Chestnut necessary for the breeding of the Black-necked Grebe. Bulgaria is the southern border of the breeding area, hence its numbers have additional fluctuations, dependent on the state of the population in the rest of the territory.</p>
		<p><b>Conservation measures taken.</b> The major breeding habitats are in the reserves Belene and Srebarna.</p>
		<p><b>Conservation measures needed.</b> Restoration of the water regime in the Belene reserve and improvement of its state.

In the second half of the 20th century it was registered during the multiplication period in the Botevgrad valley [4], the swamps around Sofia [5, 6], the Burgas lakes [7; 8, 9], the Rose Valley [10]. At present it breeds along the banks of the Danube (the Mechka fish farms), regularly along the Black Sea coast (the Alepu marshes and lakes Arkutino, Shabla and Durankulak, the most significant breeding place in Bulgaria). Among the places within the country, it incidentally breeds in the swamps of Dragoman and Straldzha [13, 14], in the fish farms near the village of Orsoya, and the drainage canals of the Mladost quarter in Sofia. During migration it is is registered throughout the country. The supposed numbers in the country are between 800 and 1 000 pairs [11].</p>
		<p><b>Habitats.</b> Vast areas of water basins with large, thin reedbeds, coloured with small water mirrors and floating water vegetation; drainage canals thickly overgrown with reed and rush [11].</p>
		<p><b>Biology.</b> Males court from the middle of April to the middle of the first decade of June. The nests are located on the water surface amongst the reed. They are built out of thin stems and leaves of reed. The clutch consists of 6-11 eggs. Both parents incubate. Data of the breeding success are missing. In the autumn, the migratory behavior is manifested immediately after sunset [16]. Food: water insects and small invertebrates [16].</p>
		<p><b>Similar species.</b> Baillon's crake (<i>Porzana pusilla</i>)<i>.</i>
		</p>
		<p><b>Negative factors.</b> Destruction of the habitats, mowing of the reed; burning the reedbeds in the winter.</p>
		<p><b>Conservation measures taken.</b> Protected according to the Biological Diversity Act. The most stable population is in Durankulak Lake, which is a Protected Locality.</p>
		<p><b>Conservation measures needed.</b> Preservation of its habitats; study of its distribution. Mapping and study of all significant reedbeds in the country, permanent monitoring of their state.</p>

		<p><b>General distribution.</b> Probably with a European type of distribution, embracing the Northern Black Sea coast, in the north to Arkhangelsk and Ural, in the east to Altai and with separate habitats in Asia.</p>
		<p><b>Distribution and abundance in Bulgaria.</b> A breeding summer visitor, insufficiently studied in the past and without certain proof of breeding [1]. During the multiplication period it was found in the lakes Srebarna [2, 3] and Durankulak [4, 5], in the valley of the town of Botevgrad [6], the swamps around Sofia and the town of Radomir and in the Yambol region [7], the Rose Valley and the Burgas lakes [8; 9]. At present it breeds along the Danube valley, irregularly along the Black Sea coast (the Burgas lakes, the tailings-ponds near the town of Malko Tarnovo) and within the country. The largest habitats are in the Dragoman Swamp and in the other water basins of the Straldzha Swamp [12, 13]. It has also been found in the Sofia field. The numbers are between 200 and 400 pairs, with considerable fluctuations in the different years [11].</p>
		<p><b>Habitats.</b> Large bogs and boggy meadows, mainly overgrown with <i>Carex</i> [11]. It prefers rice fields, turfy marshes and wet meadows along their periphery. In the brackish water basins along the Black Sea coast, mainly wandering and migrating birds are observed.</p>
		<p><b>Biology.</b> Males court from the beginning of April to the first decade of July, continuing for about 10 days. The territorial area of a pair in the Dragoman Swamp is 1,08 ha. The nests are built out of stems of swamp vegetation, hidden in thick herbaceous tufts. The clutch consists of 6-11 eggs, coloured with brown, rusty and light gray dots and spots.

		<p><b>General distribution.</b> An Old World species spread in Europe, Asia, Africa, Australia, New Zealand and Tasmania.</p>
		<p><b>Distribution and abundance in Bulgaria.</b> A breeding summer visitor and probably passage migrant. In the past it was registered in the region of Silistra [1], in Northeastern Bulgaria [2], the Burgas lakes [3], in the region of Sofia [4, 5, 6, 7], but without certain proof of breeding. During migration it was registered in the Pazardzhik region [8], the Plovdiv region [9] and along the Black Sea coast [10, 11, 12]. At present, it breeds mainly along the valley of the Danube (Srebarna [13], the bogs along the line Nikopol – Gulyantsi – Baikal and in the region of Somovit) and within the country. Most stable is the population in the Dragoman Swamp [14]. It was also registered in the Musachevo Swamp, as near the town of Voluyak. In 2005 and 2006, between the villages of Dolni Bogrov and Ravno Pole, 3-5 breeding pairs were registered for the first time. It incubates in the tailings-pond near the town of Malko Tarnovo; the fish farms near the village of Trud, Plovdiv region, the Mechka fish farms and the dried up Straldzha Swamp. Along the Black Sea coast it was reported in the Mandra Reservoir (Delov, unpublished information). The distribution is strongly fragmented, probably with considerable fluctuations in the different years. The numbers in the country are between 20 and 80 pairs. The tendencies of the population abundance and its distribution are most probably negative.</p>
		<p><b>Habitats.</b> Bogs, rice fields, turf marshes and along the periphery of wet meadows. It prefers spacious boggy areas covered with comparatively thin thick-stem herbaceous vegetation (mainly of the genus <i>Carex</i>), distributed in separate tufts and divided by small water mirrors with comparatively clear water. It avoids water basins with intensive eutrophication processes and the brackish water basins along the Black Sea coast.</p>
		<p><b>Biology.</b> The nests are built excessively from the stems of Sedge, located at 87-135 m one from the other (on an area of 0.405 ha, up to 3 pairs can breed). The clutch consists of 5-9 light-green eggs. It feeds on water insects and small invertebrates.</p>
		<p><b>Similar species.</b> The Little Crake (<i>Porzana parva</i>)<i>,</i> the Spotted Crake (<i>Porzana porzana</i>)<i>.</i>
		</p>
		<p><b>Negative factors.</b> Draining of the bogs, building dikes and roundabout roads, thus discontinuing the connection with the boggy herbaceous habitats; the variations in the water regime; mowing, pasture and the decay of rice production in the country are essential negative factors.</p>
		<p><b>Conservation measures taken.</b> The Dragoman Swamp, where the most stable breeding population is found (about 40% of the national one), is proposed to be declared Protected Territory.</p>
		<p><b>Conservation measures needed.</b> Mapping and studying the bogs and the newly arising habitats as a result of floods; discontinuation of pasture and mowing in the habitats of the species; prevention of the drying up of the bogs in the summer months.</p>

		<p><b>Distribution and abundance in Bulgaria.</b> Mainly the southeastern parts of the country: the Eastern Rhodopes, Sakar in the north to Sveti Iliyski hills, Derventski hills, Strandzha, in the north to cape Shabla, in a narrow strip (about 5 km) along the Black Sea coast and an isolated habitat in the valley of the river Malki Lom (Ruse region) [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]. The habitats from the valley of the river Struma were not confirmed from 1912, to 2003, when one individual was found near the village of Kalimantsi. Known from the valley of the Rusenski Lom are a total of 5 individuals, 4 of them caught in the 1960s, and one young individuals caught in 1984 [6]. In Strandzha, the Derventski hills, Bakadzhitsite, Sakar, Sveti Iliyski hills and the Eastern Rhodopes at places it has large numbers, established up to 15 individuals on a three-hour route, for the 1996-2006 period.</p>
		<p><b>Habitats.</b> It inhabits terrains with altitudes of up to 800 m, overgrown with dry-loving grasses and bushes, thinned deciduous forests. In the summer hot periods it enters wet ravines, forests, marshy places, etc.</p>
		<p><b>Biology.</b> It mainly feeds on large invertebrate animals and insects, less frequently on lizards, small snakes, birds (mainly nesting on the ground) and small mammals. It lays 5-10 eggs sized 30 x 16 mm. When hatching, the young ones have a length of about 11 cm. They are beige-gray, spotted with transverse brown, curly stripes on the back and lateral spots.</p>

		<p><b>Conservation status:</b> <i>in Bulgaria</i>: <b>Endangered EN </b>[A1b,d; B1b (v),c (iv)].</p>
		<p><b>General distribution.</b> It is found along the Black Sea coast, mainly in the shelf zone, where it forms local schools. It partially enters the southern parts of the Sea of Azov and the Bosphorus, and it enters occasionally the Mediterranean and the Adriatic Seas.</p>
		<p><b>Distribution and abundance in Bulgaria.</b> In the past, an abundant species along the Bulgarian Black Sea coast, representing a substantial share of the Bulgarian commercial sea catches [1, 2]. In recent years, the stocks of the species in the Black Sea drastically decreased: from 5 000 tonnes in 1970 to 500 tonnes in 1992 [3]. Therefore, in the period 1990-1994, the fishing of turbot in front of the Bulgarian coast was prohibited, which partly contributed to the restoration if its stocks. During the 2002-2005 period, however, the annual catch of turbot again decreased about 10-fold [4].</p>
		<p><b>Habitats.</b> A marine, bottom-dwelling fish. It inhabits sandy bottoms, mainly in the coastal area, at comparatively small depths.</p>
		<p><b>Biology.</b> The turbot reaches sexual maturity at the age of 3-5 years. Spawning occurs at water temperature of 8-16 &deg;C, in the period from the middle of April to the middle of June; for spawning the turbot approaches the coast to depths of 10–30 m. The fecundity of females reaches 5-6 millions of eggs at average. The turbot is a predator, feeding on fish (mainly whiting and horse mackerel), crustaceans and mollusks [2, 5, 6, 7].</p>
		<p><b>Similar species.</b> The scaldback (<i>Arnoglossus kessleri</i>). The turbot differs by the rhomboid shape of the body, scattered with bony tubercles. By the same feature, it can be differentiated from the brill(<i>Scophthalmus rhombus</i>), which also lacks bony tubercles.</p>
		<p><b>Negative factors.</b> The main threats to the species are poaching and overfishing, including that of sexually immature individuals, as well as water pollution.</p>

		<h1>Southern Ninespine Stickleback</h1>
		<p><b><i>Pungitius platygaster </i> (Kessler, 1859)</b></p>
		<p><i>Pygosteus platygaster</i> Kessler: Drensky, 1923: 77.</p>
		<p>Order Gasterosteiformes</p>
		<p>Family Gasterosteidae</p>
		<p><b>Conservation status:</b> <i>in Bulgaria</i>: <b>Critically endangered CR</b> [A1c; B1a, b (i, ii, iii)]; <i>International:</i> IUCN [LR/lc], BeC-III.</p>
		<p><b>General distribution.</b> The basins of the Black Sea, the Sea of Azov and the Caspian Sea. In the Black Sea basin, it is found in the Danube River upstream to Belgrade, in the lower reaches of the rivers Dniester, Bug and Dnieper, as well as in the deltas of the Don and the Kuban Rivers.</p>
		<p><b>Distribution and abundance in Bulgaria.</b> In the past, the species was abundant in the marshes along the Danube [1]. It was also recorded in the main channel of the Danube River, the Vidbol River, the marshes along the Kamchiya River, the lakes Shabla, Durankulak and Vaya, the Mandra Reservoir, the lakes Varna and Beloslav [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]. Recently, the species has become extremely rare, showing a continuous decline of its range. At present, it is found in Srebarna Lake [9], Durankulak Lake [10] and Varna Bay, where single specimens were caught [11], and most likely, in some Black Sea rivers, for example, in the mouth of the Marinka River [12].</p>
		<p><b>Habitats.</b> Permanent rivers, permanent fresh water lakes and marshes, coastal fresh water and brackish lagoons, as well as sea bays.</p>
		<p><b>Biology.</b> It reaches sexual maturity in the first year. The spawning period is during April-August. Fecundity varies between 10-20 and 600-700 eggs. The males build nests amongst the submerged vegetation and guard them until the eggs hatch. The life span is about 3 years. It feeds on small crustaceans, eggs and larvae of fish [8].</p>
		<p><b>Similar species.</b> Three-spined stickleback (<i>Gasterosteus aculeatus</i>), from which it is easily distinguished by the higher number (7-12) of dorsal fin spines, lack of well visible bony plates along the side and lack of a caudal peduncle keel.</p>
		<p><b>Negative factors.</b> Loss (degradation) of habitats, as a result of draining of marshlands; water pollution; pressure from introduced species.</p>
		<p><b>Conservation measures taken.</b> Listed in the Red Data Book of Bulgaria (1985) and Red Book of the Black Sea (1999). The habitats of the species in Srebarna Lake and Durankulak Lake are included within the borders of protected areas.</p>
		<p><b>Conservation measures needed.</b> Development of an Action Plan for the protection of the species in Bulgaria.</p>

		<p><b>Conservation status:</b> <i>in Bulgaria</i>: <b>Endangered EN</b> [B1(a+c(i) (iv)+2(a+c(iv)], BDA-III; <i>International:</i> BeC-II.</p>
		<p><b>General distribution.</b> Probably a Mediterranean species breeding in the Mediterranean basin, where over 95% of the world population is located. During the breeding season it goes into the open sea hundreds of kilometers away. Between June and October the population scatters in the Mediterranean and the Black Sea, where it spends the winter.</p>
		<p><b>Distribution and abundance in Bulgaria.</b> A rarely breeding summer visitor, numerous as wandering. It bred in 1938 on St. Ivan Island [1] and in 1963 and 1964 on St. Toma Island and between the rivers Veleka and Silistar [2]. According to those more than 120 observations available [3], outside the breeding period it is found along the Black Sea coast in flocks of several tens to over 37 000 individuals [4]. Since 1985 there have been no data of multiplication, but possible and probable breeding was registered in 12 habitats [5]. In the spring and in the autumn it is found along the whole shore in flocks of several individuals each to 10 200 individuals [3, 6]. During the winter, flocks are observed in Atanasovsko Ezero lake [7] up to the town of Ahtopol [8].</p>
		<p><b>Habitats.</b> Rocky sea shores (including islands).</p>
		<p><b>Biology.</b> A colonial species whose nests are in underground cavities, often dug up by the birds themselves, or in rock cracks. It lays 1egg that it incubates for 51-53 days, the young bird hatches around the end of June. A fish-eating and nocturnally active species. Most of the time it spends in the open sea in search for food.</p>
		<p><b>Similar species.</b> In the Mediterranean basin, one species, <i>Puffinus puffinus</i>, was described. In 1988, it was divided into two species: <i>P. puffinus</i> and <i>P. yelkouan</i>. In 2000, <i>P. yelkouan</i> was divided into another two species: <i>P. yelkouan</i> and <i>P. mauretanicus</i> [9].</p>
		<p><b>Negative factors.</b> Understudied. Possible threats: overcatch in industrial fishing, death of hooks or falling into fishing nets, intensive building along the Black Sea coast, lighting of possible breeding places (cape Kaliakra), flooding of areas by crude oil products and other pollution of the sea.</p>
		<p><b>Conservation measures taken.</b> Protected according to the Biological Diversity Act. In the Kaliakra Reserve, the St. Ivan Island Protected Locality, etc., potentially significant territories are protected. Important Bird Areas with considerable aquatories have been proposed for inclusion in the <i>Natura 2000</i> network [10].</p>
		<p><b>Conservation measures needed.</b> Preparation of a National Plan for its preservation, working out management plans for the sites of key significance for the species, monitoring, stable use of the fish resources of the Black Sea, preservation of the rocky sections along the shore.</p>

			<b>Vulnerable VU </b>B1b(I, iii, iv, v) c(i, iii, v); C2a(i), BDA-III.</p>
		<p><b>General distribution.</b> A Paleomontane species. It breeds in Southern Europe, Northern Africa, Iran, Central Asia, the Caucasus Mountains, the Himalaya range (12).</p>
		<p><b>Distribution and abundance in Bulgaria.</b> Resident. In the past it was rather common along the high rocky peaks of the mountains Rila, Pirin, Alibotush, the Rhodopes and the Balkan range and their lower karstic terrains [4]. Its numbers sharply declined and in many places are now on the verge of extinction [1]. Until the 1960s and the 1970s it bred in many karstic regions of Bulgaria [7] and mostly in karstic precipices in the Western Balkan range [9], the Iskar Gorge [5] and the mountains Ponor Planina and Vrachanska Planina [8]. The present distribution includes high rocky regions in the mountains Rila, Pirin, the Central Balkan range and Slavyanka. There are separate dying breeding places in the Western Balkan range [6, 10], in the Vrachanska mountain [10, 6, 12] and Vasilyovska Planina [2]. It breeds in Osogovska Planina mountain [11]. On 9 October 2005, in Radyuva Planina mountain, 3 birds were observed (B. Petrov, personal communication). In 2006, the species was not registered in the high parts of the Western Rhodopes. The total numbers in the country are about 2 800 pairs [3].</p>
		<p><b>Habitats.</b> Rocky regions in the subalpine and alpine belt, rarely in rocky terrains situated lower.</p>
		<p><b>Biology.</b> It multiplies in precipice caves and along open rock vertical slopes, and in abandoned underground mines. It breeds colonially, less often in separate pairs. The multiplication period begins about the middle of April-May. The nests are on platforms, in niches and on the bottoms of precipices and other deep shelters on rocks. It lays from 2 to 6 eggs (usually 3-4). Incubation continues for about 18-20 days, the young ones leave the nests at the age of 25-30 days. It feeds on insects and fruits, waste on the dumping grounds of mountain huts, rarely small vertebrate animals and carrion. During the autumn-winter season it makes vertical migrations and wanderings, sometimes tens of kilometers outside the breeding areas.</p>
		<p><b>Similar species.</b> The Chough (<i>Pyrrhocorax pyrrhocorax</i>).</p>
		<p><b>Negative factors.</b> Change of the nutrition habitats (high grass growing on the pastures and meadows) after the demise of pasture animal breeding. Overgrowing of the entrances and throwing waste into the precipices; illegal shooting; disturbance by speleologists and rock climbers in the breeding places. Probably also chemical preparations and heavy metals [12].</p>
		<p><b>Conservation measures taken.</b> Protected according to the Biological Diversity Act. Most of the breeding places are in Protected Territories.</p>
		<p><b>Conservation measures needed.</b> Change of agricultural practices. Information campaigns among hunters, local citizens, speleologists and rock climbers.</p>

		<p><b>General distribution.</b> Africa; Italy, Sicily, the Balkan peninsula; Israel, Jordan, Syria and Yemen; Cyprus; Turkey; Transcaucasia, Iran, Afganistan and Pakistan.</p>
		<p><b>Distribution and abundance in Bulgaria.</b> About 60 localities are found [1]. In the southern parts of the country the species is comparatively ordinary and with a higher frequency of finding and abundance [2]. The western and the central parts of the Prebalkan region and the line Veliko Tarnovo – Kotel – Primorsko outline part of the northern border of the range. The minimal estimate of the summer population is about 5 000 individuals. For the cave-loving species of bats, to which the Blasius' horseshoe bat belongs, a decrease of the numbers by 20-40% at the average was registered in the 1988-1992 period with respect to the 1955-1971 period [3].</p>
		<p><b>Habitats.</b> Karstic regions in the valleys and the hilly parts of the country. It is entirely linked to underground shelters: caves and mine galleries.</p>
		<p><b>Biology.</b> It forms colonies with numbers of several hundred to several thousand individuals, often together with the Mediterranean horseshoe bat (<i>Rh. euryale</i>) and Mehely's horseshoe bat (<i>Rh. mehelyi</i>). The maximum of birth givings is in the period 20 June –10 July. Wintering colonies are known only from the caves Ayna Ini and Samara (the village of Ribino, the Eastern Rhodopes), Parnitsite (the village of Bezhanovo) and Morovitsa (the village of Glozhene). It does not migrate but makes regular seasonal trips between the summer and the winter shelters.</p>
		<p><b>Similar species.</b> Mediterranean horseshoe bat (<i>Rhinolophus euryale</i>) and Mehely's horseshoe bat (<i>Rhinolophus mehelyi</i>).</p>
		<p><b>Negative factors.</b> Anthropogenic influence on the shelters: destruction or disturbance in them, placing doors and bars that prevent or hinder the access to them and lead to a change of the microclimate. Anthropogenic pressure on the hunting habitats and flight corridors, for example the destruction and the fragmentation of the natural deciduous forests.</p>
		<p><b>Conservation measures taken.</b> The species is protected according to the Biological Diversity Act, EUROBATS and all the other conventions (without CITES). Many of the underground shelters in Bulgaria fall within different categories of protected territories. The inclusion of the known shelters in the <i>Natura 2000</i> network of protected zones is about to be effected.</p>
		<p><b>Conservation measures needed.</b> Protection of underground shelters. Working out detailed management plans for those that are declared protected territories. Studies for clarifying the &quot;interim&quot; (spring and autumn) copulative shelters and of concrete hunting habitats and flight corridors, so that they should also be protected. The negative effect of urbanization, in so far as the species avoids urbanized habitats. The complex conservation approach requires the preservation of the habitats within a radius of at least 5 km from the summer shelters. Continuation of the yearly monitoring in the significant underground shelters of bats [4].</p>

		<p><b>General distribution.</b> Southern Europe, in the east through Transcuacasia to Iran and Turkmenistan, the Mediterranean islands, Northern Africa.</p>
		<p><b>Distribution and abundance in Bulgaria.</b> The most widespead and most numerous of the three species of "medium-sized" horseshoe bats on the territory of the country [1]. It is known from over 100 localities [2], most of them being between altitudes of 0 – 700 m, but it has winter shelters at higher altitudes as well. Its frequency declines to the south. The minimal summer population size is about 40 000 individuals. For the cave-loving species of bats, to which the Mediterranean horseshoe bat belongs, a decrease of the numbers of 20-40% at the average was registered in the 1988-1992 period with respect to the 1955-1971 period [3].</p>
		<p><b>Habitats.</b> Forested lowland karstic regions close to water. It is almost entirely linked to caves, but in non-karstic regions in the summer it also settles in buildings [4, 5].</p>
		<p><b>Biology.</b> It mainly feeds on nocturnal butterflies. Of the nursery colonies known until now, 18 are in natural caves and one is in the underground tunnels of a building [2]. The maximum of birth-giving is in the period 20 June – 10 July. The winter colonies are numerous: in caves and less often in artificial galleries. It does not migrate at large distances but makes regular seasonal trips between the summer and the winter shelters (10-60 km).</p>
		<p><b>Similar species.</b> Mehely's horseshoe bat (<i>Rhinolophus mehelyi</i>) and Blasius' horseshoe bat (<i>Rhinolophus blasii</i>).</p>

			<b>Vulnerable VU</b> [A2c], BDA-II, III; <i>International:</i> IUCN-VU [A2c], BeC-II, III, BoC-II, HD-II, IV.</p>
		<p><b>General distribution.</b> Southern Europe (in the north up to Southern France, Italy and Eastern Romania), in the east through the Caucasus Mountains to Iran and Iraq, including Jordan and Israel, the Mediterranean islands, Northern Africa.</p>
		<p><b>Distribution and abundance in Bulgaria.</b> Known from 29 localities in the low parts of the country, whereby those in Northwestern Bulgaria outline part of the northern border of the range [1]. It has comparatively low numbers: about 10 000 individuals. It may be assumed that similar to the other cave-loving species of bats there is a decrease of the numbers, 20-40% at the average [2].</p>
		<p><b>Habitats.</b> Lowland karstic regions. It is entirely linked to caves as shelters [1].</p>
		<p><b>Biology.</b> It mainly feeds on nocturnal butterflies that it catches over open habitats. It forms "mixed" nursery and winter colonies with the Mediterranean horseshoe bat and Blasius' horseshoe bat with numbers between several hundred to several thousand individuals. The 6 nursery colonies known so far are in natural caves. The maximum of birth-givings is in the period 20 June – 10 July. It winters mainly in caves. It does not make distant migrations but regular seasonal movements have been registered between summer and winter shelters.</p>
		<p><b>Similar species.</b> The Mediterranean horseshoe bat (<i>Rhinolophus euryale</i>) and Blasius' horseshoe bat (<i>Rh. blasii</i>).</p>
		<p><b>Negative factors.</b> Anthropogenic pressure on the significant underground shelters, for example the caves Orlova chuka, Ruse region, Zandana, Shumen region, and Devetashka, Lovech region, are the object of increased tourism that does not conform to the requirements for the preservation of bats. At places underground shelters are being entirely destroyed. Felling and fragmentation of natural deciduous forests degrades the quality of hunting habitats and flight corridors. Urbanization has a negative effect.</p>
		<p><b>Conservation measures taken.</b> The species is protected according to the Biological Diversity Act, EUROBATS and all the other conventions (without CITES). Many of the underground shelters in Bulgaria fall within different categories of protected territories. The inclusion of the known shelters in the <i>Natura 2000</i> network of protected zones is about to be effected.</p>
		<p><b>Conservation measures needed.</b> Preservation of underground shelters. Working out detailed management plans for those shelters that are declared protected territories. Additional studies for finding "interim" (spring and autumn) copulative shelters (swarming sites) and concrete hunting habitats and flight corridors, so that they can be protected as well. The complex conservation approach requires the preservation of the habitats within a radius of at least 5 km from the summer shelters. Continuation of the yearly monitoring in the significant underground shelters of bats [3].</p>

		<p><b>General distribution.</b> In the lower reaches of the rivers flowing into the Black Sea and the western part of the Caspian Sea.</p>
		<p><b>Distribution and abundance in Bulgaria.</b> It has occurred in the rivers Karaagach, Veleka and Rezovska [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]. A very rare species of low abundance. The population in the Karaagach River can be considered extinct, as during studies in 2005, the species was not recorded [8]. In the Veleka River, it was found only in the lowest reaches, downstream the village of Brodilovo, where the population was of low abundance and biomass [6, 7]. There are no data about the state of the population in the Rezovska River.</p>
		<p><b>Habitats.</b> It is found in permanent rivers, including their estuaries.</p>
		<p><b>Biology.</b> It lives in small shoals mainly in the deep parts of the rivers. It reaches sexual maturity at the age of 2-4 years. Spawning occurs in April-May. The species migrates upstream and lays its eggs in shallow water, among weeds and over stony substrate. The fecundity of females ranges between 90 000 and 250 000 eggs. The species feeds on algae and small invertebrate animals. It reaches a maximum length of 60 cm and a maximum weight of 1,5 kg [5].</p>
		<p><b>Similar species.</b> The roach (<i>R. rutilus</i>) and the European chub (<i>Leuciscus cephalus</i>).

			<i>balcanica </i>Bolkay, 1925, distributed in some higher mountains in the Balkans (without Croatia).</p>
		<p><b>Distribution and abundance in Bulgaria.</b> In the past: in the Balkan range, Sredna gora, Vitosha and the Rilo-Rhodope massif [1]. From the end of the 19th century to the 1930s it declined in a threatening manner, disappearing from Sredna gora and Vitosha; at the end of the period the numbers were 1 000 individuals [2], from 1965 to 1984 – 1 500 individuals at the average. For 1985-1994, predominant is the opinion about numbers like 1 600 – 1 800 individuals [1, 3, Bulgarian Forestries Questionnaire – 1989, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]; in 1997-2000 the numbers were only 1 000 – 1 100 individuals [10, 11, 12, 13], and until 2005 they rose to 1 600 – 1 800 individuals: the Central Balkan range – 200-220, Rila – 450-500, Pirin – 200, the Western Rhodopes – 750-850 individuals [9, 12, 14,15, taxations in national parks]. The density on the area inhabited in Bulgaria is 1 – 2 individuals/ 100 ha at the average. In Rila – 4.8 individuals [P. Genov – unpubl.]</p>
		<p><b>Habitats.</b> Steep rocky slopes and massifs in the forests and the high mountainous forest-free zone.</p>
		<p><b>Biology.</b> The mating season in the Balkan range is in October – November, in Pirin from November to the middle of December [3, 16]. Most females start to breed in the third year, and males in the fourth and fifth year. Pregnancy lasts for 160-175 days; most often there is one young. In the summer and the early autumn, the herds of the females reach 40-50 individuals [7]. It feeds during the day [1].</p>
		<p><b>Similar species.</b> None.</p>
		<p><b>Negative factors.</b> Hybridization with animals of the nominal subspecies imported in 1977-8 in the Rhodopes [1, 15, 17]; the recent population forming in Vitosha from the Rhodopes is also probably hybrid. Isolation of the subpopulatons. Strong poaching impact. Decrease of the inhabited territory. Urbanization, disturbance by tourism and the packs of dogs gone wild.</p>
		<p><b>Conservation measures taken.</b> The first measures are dated back to the end of the 19th century. A protected species as of 2007, 60 % of the population inhabits the national parks Pirin, Central Balkan and Rila, the Rila Monastery Natural Park and reserves in the Western Rhodopes. Included in the Red Data Book of Bulgaria as an endangered species. Conservation plans [7, 15].</p>
		<p><b>Conservation measures needed.</b> Urgent investigation of the gene fund of the subspecies and the consequences of hybridization. Measures for restriction of the hybridization. Preparation of an international plan for the preservation of the subspecies. Inclusion of the subspecies in the Red List of IUCN.</p>

		<p><b>General distribution.</b> Europe: an endemic species in the lower reaches of the Danube River. It is found in Serbia, Romania and Bulgaria.</p>
		<p><b>Distribution and abundance in Bulgaria.</b> The species was first described from the Danube River near Vidin [1]. Its occurrence was reported along the entire Bulgarian stretch of the Danube from Vidin to Silistra, entering for reproduction several kilometers upstream the mouths of its bigger tributaries: Ogosta, Iskar, Vit, Osam and Yantra [2, 3]. Later, it was again reported in the Danube [4, 5, 6] and the Yantra River, where it was recorded as far as the village of Polsko Kosovo, over 40 km from the mouth [7]. Recently, it has been found in the Danube [our data]. Its spawning migration upstream the other Danube tributaries has not been confirmed.</p>
		<p><b>Habitats.</b> Permanent large rivers with gravel bottom and fast current.</p>
		<p><b>Biology.</b> A benthic, reophilic species. It inhabits the main channel of the Danube River at depths from 9 to 15 m, sometimes reaching 20 m. In the period May-June, it migrates towards the river mouths for spawning. The eggs are released several kilometers upstream. The larvae hatch in 5-7 days. Shortly after hatching, they return to the Danube again. It feeds on benthic invertebrate animals, mainly during the night. It reaches a maximum length of 10 cm [3, 8].</p>
		<p><b>Similar species.</b> The Balkan spined loach (<i>S. balcanica</i>). The Danube spined loach is distinguished by the comparatively shorter body length and higher body depth, as well as by the lower number of spots, bigger in size, on the sides of the body.</p>

		<p><b>General distribution.</b> A Balkan endemic species distributed in Albania, Macedonia, Greece (without Eastern Macedonia and Thrace) and in the past also in Western Bulgaria.</p>
		<p><b>Distribution and abundance in Bulgaria.</b> Found in Bulgaria only in Lyulin Mts., in the gorge of Vladaya River above Knyazhevo, where in 1938, 1939 and 1940 six females were collected [1], correctly identified as late as in 2003 [2]. It was not found later in the same locality or elsewhere in Bulgaria. Because of its large size, the species cannot remain unobserved during the frequent visits to Lyulin by entomologists. The Lyulin population was the northernmost one in the species range. Most likely <i>Saga hellenica</i> occured there in few specimens only.</p>
		<p><b>Habitats.</b> In the past it inhabited low-mountainous dry meadows, sometimes used for pasture. In Vodno Mts. (Northern Macedonia) it occurs on shrubs and more rarely in the grass in open stony terrains and light xerophytic forests at altitudes between 500 and 1 000 m.</p>
		<p><b>Biology.</b> There is no information about the biology of the Lyulin population before its extinction (the species was correctly identified [2] only after its disappearance) but such data exist about the Macedonian and Greek populations. The nymphs hatch in March and the beginning of April. They moult six times. Duration of every nymphal instar: 8-10 days; of the whole nymphal stage: 50-60 days. The adult lives from the end of May to August. It lays eggs in the soil. <i>Saga hellenica</i> overwinters as an egg. The egg stage may lengthen up to several years (a hyperpause). A narrowly specialized predator with a stalking behaviour. Its food consists of large grasshoppers and praying mantids. It has no competitors in its food niche.</p>
		<p><b>Similar species.</b> It differs from <i>Saga natoliae</i> with its more slender habitus and smaller size, and from <i>S. campbelli</i>, <i>S. rammei</i> and <i>S. pedo</i> with the shape and colouring of the pronotum, the larger size and the more robust habitus.</p>
		<p><b>Negative factors.</b> The restricted distribution in Bulgaria and the changes of the habitat as a result of human activity are the most probable reasons for the regional extinction of the species.</p>

		<p><b>Distribution and abundance in Bulgaria.</b> A rare species in the Bulgarian aquatory of the Black Sea. In the past, it was caught along the Black Sea coast from Varna to Sozopol [1, 2, 3]. It migrated into the Danube River for spawning [4], and was found near Silistra [5]. There is no information about the current state of its population. There are data that the species was recorded in the Black Sea near Varna, Nesebar and Sozopol, as well as in the Danube River [4], but it probably declined sharply in numbers. Recently, single specimens have been caught in the Danube River near Ruse [6].</p>
		<p><b>Habitats.</b> It is found in the open sea and in estuaries; it enters permanent large rivers for spawning.</p>
		<p><b>Biology.</b> It has two forms: anadromous and resident. The anadromous form is found along the entire shelf zone of the Black Sea and part of the Sea of Azov and enters the rivers for spawning. The migration of the adult individuals begins in April-May, and the spawning period lasts from the middle of October to January. The fecundity of females ranges from 2 500 to 15 500 eggs. The hatching of larvae takes place at water temperature of about 9-10 &deg;C in the period from the middle of December to February. The migration of juveniles to the sea occurs in the autumn, before reaching 2 years of age. It reaches sexual maturity in the third year at a body length of 35-90 cm.

		<p><b>Distribution and abundance in Bulgaria.</b> A breeding summer visitor and wintering species, until 1950 widely distributed both in the mountains and in the low mountainous and flat forest areas [4, 5, 6, 7]<i>. </i>In the 1950-1985 period there was a considerable decrease of breeding and of the migration numbers. The data about breeding are singular, unconfirmed by evidence [4, 7, 8, 9, 10]. In recent years separate pairs have been breeding in the forest zone of the mountains Rila, Pirin, the Western Rhodopes and the Balkan range [7, 11, 12] and in lower mountains such as Strandzha and Maleshevska [7, 12, 13]. Of the total of 48 habitats known, 17 were confirmed during the last 20 years. Currently, the tendency in the numbers is unknown. Supposed breeding numbers are 200-400 pairs. During migration and wintering it is found throughout the country, but in low numbers.</p>
		<p><b>Habitats.</b> Boreal forests and forests in the moderate zone. It breeds in various forest habitats – deciduous (beech, oak), mixed and coniferous forests, from altitudes of about 400 (Strandzha) to 1800 m. It is found more often in mountainous spruce, spruce-Scotch pine and white fir forests.</p>
		<p><b>Biology.</b> Courting is most active in April and the beginning of May and takes place mainly in the early evening. It builds its nest on the ground on the forest cover. It lays 4 white to dark brown eggs [1, 12]. In danger the female takes the eggs in her beak to another place [14]. It feeds on worms, larvae and adult insects, rarely small fruits [1].</p>

		<p><b>General distribution.</b> The northern part of the Atlantic Ocean and the adjacent seas: the Black Sea, the Sea of Marmara and the Mediterranean Sea. Along the Atlantic coast of Europe – from the Canary Islands northward to the North Sea, the Baltic Sea, the Norwegian Sea and the Barents Sea; along the Atlantic coast of North America – from Cape Hatteras to Labrador.</p>
		<p><b>Distribution and abundance in Bulgaria.</b> In the past (until 1970), the Atlantic mackerel was one of the most valuable commercially Black Sea fish species in Bulgaria [1, 2, 3]. It overwintered in the Sea of Marmara, and in the spring, it entered the Black Sea and moved northward for feeding. When passing along the Bulgarian coast, it was caught in large quantities. In the autumn, on its way back to the Sea of Marmara, already well-fed, the species was again an object of commercial fishing. During the last 46 years, however, the entering of the species into the Black Sea stopped abruptly, and at present, single specimens are caught very rarely [4].</p>
		<p><b>Habitats.</b> It is found only in the open sea<b><i>.</i></b></p>
		<p><b>Biology.</b> In the period February–May, the species overwinters and spawns in the Sea of Marmara at a depth of 50–70 m, water temperature of 14°C and salinity over 38‰. Sexual maturity is attained in the first year. The fecundity of females varies from 164 000 to 335 000 eggs. They spawn repeatedly. The eggs are pelagic. It has a mixed type of feeding. In the spring and autumn, it preys predominantly on fish – Mediterranean sand eel, anchovy, small horse mackerel, sprat and sand smelt, while in the summer, it feeds mostly on zooplankton [2, 5].</p>
		<p><b>Similar species.</b> In the Black Sea and the Sea of Marmara, another species belonging to the family Scombridae is found - the chub mackerel (<i>Scomber japonicus</i>). The Atlantic mackerel differs by the absence of a swim bladder and by having a white, unmarked belly.</p>

		<p><b>General distribution.</b> A Mediterranean species whose breeding area embraces Southeastern Europe, Turkey, Israel, Iran, Iraq, Caucasus [13].</p>
		<p><b>Distribution and abundance in Bulgaria.</b> Resident. In the past it was found in the mountains in the Rhodopes and in Southwestern Bulgaria [10]; in the mountains Rila, at altitudes of about 2 200 m, and Pirin, at altitudes of about 2 000 m, and in Kresna Gorge [7]; around the Struma River near the Rupite locality [5]; in the southern parts of Kresna Gorge [1]; near Krupnik railway station [12]; in the low parts of the mountains Ograzhden, Maleshevska Planina, Pirin and Rhodopes [3]. The present distribution includes rocky terrains in the Eastern Rhodopes [11]; the Western Rhodopes – more frequently in the low parts of Dabrash [14]; in the Trigrad-Yagodinski region [4, 14]; the Karadzhov Kamak locality [10], etc. In Southwestern Bulgaria it is found along the valley of the Struma: near the Rupite locality, Kresna Gorge, etc., in the north reaching Zemenski Gorge; along the Mesta – under the village of Eleshnitsa, the Momina Klisura pass, etc. It also breeds in the low parts of the mountains Pirin, Western Rila, Ograzhden, Maleshevska and Vlahina [14]. The numbers are about 600 pairs [6].</p>
		<p><b>Habitats.</b> Open rocky regions in the southern parts of the country, it prefers terrains with lower altitudes.</p>
		<p><b>Biology.</b> It multiplies on vertical rocks: from 2-3 m to a height of several tens of meters. The nests are in holes, cracks, etc.; rarely in the walls of buildings [15]. In front, the nesting chamber is closed with a barrier of stuck mud and small stones in which there is a round entrance opening. In April it lays 6-13 white eggs with rusty brown spots [3]. The young ones hatch after 15-18 days and stay in the nest for about 28 days. Yearly, it has 1-2 clutches [2]. It feeds on insects; in the autumn and the winter on seeds and fruits.</p>
		<p><b>Similar species.</b> The European Nuthatch (<i>Sitta europea</i>).</p>

		<p>Family Alderflies (Sialidae)</p>
		<p><b>Conservation status:</b> <i>in Bulgaria</i>: <b>Critically Endangered CR </b>[B1ab(iii)+2a].</p>
		<p><b>General distribution.</b> Ireland, Great Britain, Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany, Denmark, Poland, Spain, France, Italy, Switzerland, Austria, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, Slovenia, Croatia, Bulgaria and Greece.</p>
		<p><b>Distribution and abundance in Bulgaria.</b> Known only from Sinovishte Lake near Devetaki Village, Lovech Region (1967) [1]. The restricted area of the only locality serves as evidence of a probably rather small population.</p>
		<p><b>Habitats.</b> In Bulgaria, karstic lakes, inhabited by the water larvae, and vegetation around them, inhabited by the adults. Sinovishte is a non-flowing lake with a length of 130 m and a depth of 5 m. In Central Europe the species prefers flowing lakes with a larger area [2].</p>
		<p><b>Biology.</b> The adults are diurnal, they almost do not eat and are found in April (in the rest of the range from the middle of May to the end of June). They lay about 900 eggs on dry grasses and thin small branches at a distance between 0.5 and 3 m over the water surface but not on the green shore vegetation [2]. The hatched larvae fall into the water. The young larvae swim freely, and the mature ones live in the silt of the bottom of standing water bodies, being active during the night. They feed on worms, molluscs and insect larvae. The number of larval instars is about 10. The last instar larvae go out onto the shore where they pupate. The development cycle lasts for two years with two overwinterings of the larvae.</p>
		<p><b>Similar species.</b> <i>Sialis lutaria</i> and <i>S. fuliginosa</i>. It differs from them in the structure of male and female genitalia.</p>
		<p><b>Negative factors.</b> Marshing of the karstic lake. Water pollution by animal breeding. Restricted distribution and low density. The water larvae of <i>Sialis nigripes</i> are strongly vulnerable during pollution of the small water body, the only one they are found in in Bulgaria.</p>
		<p><b>Conservation measures taken.</b> None.</p>
		<p><b>Conservation measures needed.</b> Restoration of the habitat by bringing back the natural appearance of the lake that is gradually becoming marshy. Study of the abundance and the area of the population and of the status of the habitat. Monitoring.</p>

		<p><b>General distribution.</b> The steppe zone of the Palearctic – from Eastern Austria, Hungary and Romania to Altai, Balkhash lake and Baikal lake, probably also Northwestern China.</p>
		<p><b>Distribution and abundance in Bulgaria.</b> Until 1985 two findings were known. At the beginning of the 20th century a report was published of an individual from Bulgaria without an exact habitat [1]. The second report is from the middle of the 20th century, from the surroundings of General Toshevo (Dobrich region) [2].</p>
		<p><b>Habitats</b>. Steppes with different grasses, forest steppes, arable areas [3]. According to data from the region of Constanta (Romania), the species is represented by low numbers in fallow lands and areas occupied by forage cultures, and in April and August it also enters areas with corn cultures; it is absent in the arable fields and the field-protecting belts [4].</p>
		<p><b>Biology.</b> It is active mainly in the night, but goes out in search of food also during the day. Hibernates in the winter. For shelter it uses holes and tunnels of other rodents and different other shelters. The feeding of the species has not been studied in Bulgaria. According to data from the literature, it feeds on seeds of herbaceous plants and insects [5]. There are no data about breeding in Bulgaria. According to literature data, the mating period is from the end of May to the beginning of June. A second generation is not proved. The number of the young is up to 7, most often 5 [6]. A major lethal factor is predation. It is attacked by predatory mammals and nocturnal birds of prey. In Bulgaria it has been found in pellets of owls (the village of Kamen bryag, Dobrich region), [7]. It probably competes for food resources with the much more numerous steppe mound-building mouse (<i>Mus spicilegus</i>).</p>
		<p><b>Similar species.</b> None.</p>
		<p><b>Negative factors.</b> Extensive agriculture, pollution of the soils with pesticides and fertilizers, restricted opportunities for re-settling, a restricted range of the species in Bulgaria.</p>
		<p><b>Conservation measures taken.</b> The species is protected according to the Biological Diversity Act.</p>
		<p><b>Necessary conservation needed.</b> Studies on its numbers and distribution; collection of information on its biology and ecology; establishing the state and the distribution of the optimal habitats; estimation of the threats. Working out a plan for management, including conservation measures. Organization of targeted monitoring.</p>

		<p><b>Distribution and abundance in Bulgaria.</b> Reported with certainty on a male specimen only in the Veleka River near the Kovach site, to the south of Zvezdets Village near Malko Tarnovo [1]. The only sure locality in Bulgaria is the southernmost one in the range. In the 1980s in this border part of the range, <i>Sisyra terminalis</i> had a considerably lower abundance than the other three species of the family in Strandzha. Throughout its area, the species has a low population density [2].</p>
		<p><b>Habitats.</b> Flowing waters, mainly large lowland rivers (larvae) and deciduous woody and shrubby vegetation along their banks (adults). The current of the Veleka river near Kovach is comparatively fast.</p>
		<p><b>Biology.</b> The adults are active day and night, with a maximum early in the evening, at twilight. They fly from the end of May to the beginning of September in two generations. Their food consists of pollen of coniferous trees, small dead arthropods, living aphids [3]. They lay about 50 eggs in cracks in the bark of horizontal branches over the water in groups covered with web. The larvae of the three instars parasitize on freshwater sponges (Porifera). The last instar larvae build a cocoon on the riverbanks, in which they turn into prepupa, and then into a pupa. The early hatched larvae of the second generation overwinter as prepupa, and the late hatched ones, as a second instar larva [3].</p>
		<p><b>Similar species.</b> The other three species of the genus in Bulgaria, from which it differs with its two-colour antennae.</p>
		<p><b>Negative factors.</b> Water pollution. Restricted distribution and low density. The water larvae of <i>Sisyra terminalis</i> are strongly vulnerable in cases of pollution of the only river in which they were found with certainty in Bulgaria.</p>

		<p><b>Distribution and abundance in Bulgaria.</b> A high mountain species found in the Tiha Rila site near the Rilska River above Rila Monastery (2001) [1] and later also in four localities in Central and Eastern Rila (2005) (unpublished data) at an altitude of 2 000 – 2 100 m. There are no data about its abundance.</p>
		<p><b>Habitats.</b> Peat bogs with densely overgrown water surface (mainly with <i>Carex rostrata</i> or mosses of the genera <i>Sphagnum</i> and <i>Drepanocladus</i>) and depths of 10 to 50 cm [1].</p>
		<p><b>Biology.</b> Adults occur in July and August and are active only in fully lit sections. The males fly over territories with areas of about 5-7 m2. They keep close over the plants and move with a smooth flight. They often hover in the air. Their activity abruptly decreases when a cloud appears and shadows the area they fly over.</p>
		<p><b>Similar species.</b> The species of the genera <i>Somatochlora</i> and <i>Cordulia</i>. <i>Somatochlora arctica</i> differs by its specific colouring of the face and the dark body.

		<p><b>General distribution.</b> The Balkan peninsula, Central Europe (the Pannonian plain), isolated populations in Moldova, the Ukraine, Germany (extinct), Poland (extinct).</p>
		<p><b>Distribution and abundance in Bulgaria.</b> It is found throughout the country, in the mountains at altitudes of up to 2 500 m [1]. In the middle of the 20th century, in favourable conditions, the density reached 16-35 individuals/ha, and at places up to 65 individuals/ha [2] and more. Modern data show a significant decrease in numbers and/or a reduction of the settled area and its disappearance in separate localities.</p>
		<p><b>Habitats.</b> Non-arable areas (abandoned lands, pastures, meadows, etc.), covered with low herbaceous vegetation, on homogeneous, badly sealed water-permeable soils [3]. It does not settle in arable areas, although it enters them for feeding [2].</p>
		<p><b>Biology.</b> A ground species with a diurnal activity. It forms within-populational local groupings ("colonies"), occupying an area of 3-5 ha, in rare cases 100-150 ha, within which the separate animals inhabit overlapping individual areas and maintain a system of nesting and shelter holes [2, 3, 4]. The annual life cycle has a marked periodicity: winter sleep (hibernation), awakening and coupling, pregnancy and lactation, preparation for hibernation. It breeds once yearly. The females give birth to up to 7 young, rarely 9. It feeds on the green parts of herbaceous plants, bulbs, seeds, insects and, rarely, vertebrate animals [6, 2]. It occupies an important place in ecosystems, as a nutrition resource of practically all diurnal rapacious birds and predatory mammals.</p>
		<p><b>Similar species.</b> None.</p>
		<p><b>Negative factors.</b> Ploughing virgin lands and creation of large massifs of arable areas, building, forestation, direct persecution, succession changes in the habitats as a result of the decrease of pasture animal breeding and mostly sheep-breeding.</p>
		<p><b>Conservation measures taken.</b> It is included in the Biological Diversity Act, Annex 2. Some of the mountainous populations are within the national parks Rila and Central Balkan. The planning of the <i>Natura 2000</i> network of protected territories is adapted to the current state of the species. It is included in the National System for Monitoring Biological Diversity. Monitoring is carried out at the national parks Central Balkan and Rila and in the Rhodopes. Information materials have been prepared (slogans, brochures, billboards) about the necessity for its preservation.</p>
		<p><b>Conservation measures needed.</b> Detailed mapping of the distribution, explanation of the intraspecific structure [7] and assessment of the state of the numbers of local populations and their habitats. Effective application of the Biological Diversity Act for priority preservation of its habitats by working out regional management plans in the context of the programmes for the development of rural regions and, in particular, the implementation of traditional practices for pasture animal breeding.</p>

		<p><b>General distribution.</b> Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria, the Ukraine, Central and Southern Russia, Armenia and the Caspian coast of Azerbaijan, Russia, Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan.</p>
		<p><b>Distribution and abundance in Bulgaria.</b> In the past, this species was found in the dune complexes located to the south of Cape Emine: Slanchev Bryag [1, 2], Nesebar [1, 2, 3, 4] and around Alepu Swamp [4]. Its abundance and density were highest in the environs of Nesebar. Until the beginning of the 1970s, it was there that the most appropriate habitats for it (vast areas occupied by white dunes) existed. <i>Stibaropus henkei</i> was found in 2004-2006 in the protected areas of Kamchiyski Pyasatsi and Arkutino, the sand bar between Pomoriysko Lake and the sea, the Oasis camping site near Lozenets Village and on collection specimens it was established for the environs of Shabla (unpublished data).</p>
		<p><b>Habitats.</b> Shore and continental sand dunes. In Bulgaria, it inhabits newly emerged shifting dunes and shifting dunes with European beachgrass (<i>Ammophila arenaria</i>).</p>
		<p><b>Biology.</b> A psammophilous species. It lives in the wet sand. The nymphs and the adults feed on the roots of <i>Leymus racemosus</i>, <i>Ammophila arenaria</i>, <i>Elymus farctus</i>, burying themselves at depths between 5 and 50 cm. The species overwinters as adult or as third to fifth instar nymph [5, 6]. Mating of the overwintered adults takes place on the sand surface from May to July. The eggs are laid in the wet sand near the roots of the host plant [5, 6]. The first nymphs of the new generation hatch in June, those of the eggs laid later occur until November. The adults and the nymphs stick around the roots of the host plants and when the sand is shuffled they are first found by their smell [5, 6].</p>
		<p><b>Similar species.</b> None.</p>
		<p><b>Negative factors.</b> The expanding urban and infrastructure development and the increase of the tourist flow along the Black Sea coast leading to change and destruction of the sandy dune habitats.</p>
		<p><b>Conservation measures taken.</b> The localities to the south of the mouth of the Kamchiya river and near Arkutino are included in protected areas.</p>
		<p><b>Conservation measures needed.</b> Conservation of the existing protected territories and creation of new ones, with a strict regime of preservation of the last remaining dune complexes along the Bulgarian Black Sea coast.</p>

		<p><b>Distribution and abundance in Bulgaria.</b> A breeding summer visitor and passage migrant. At the beginning of the 20th century it bred with large numbers along the Danube, the valley of the Maritsa River, near the towns of Pomorie and Sozopol, probably also near Sofia [5, 8, 9, 10, 14]. The major population after the 80s was concentrated in the Burgas wetlands, where it breeds on artificial islands and platforms [1-4, 6, 11, 13]. At present it breeds in 13 habitats, more important among which are: Atanasovsko Ezero lake, Pomoriysko Ezero lake, Poda Protected Locality, Zmiyskiya Ostrov island, the mouth of the Ropotamo River, islands and marshes of the Danube and some of the larger internal rivers [1-4, 13, 15].

		<p><b>General distribution.</b> A Turkestan species distributed in the arid-steppe zone of Eurasia: from Southeastern Europe to Central Asia in the east.</p>
		<p><b>Distribution and abundance in Bulgaria.</b> A breeding summer visitor and passage migrant. There are data about breeding as early as from the end of 19th century, including the Sofia region [1, 2]. Most observations of breeding colonies are, however, from the Northern Black Sea coast [3, 4, 5, 6]. After 1985, most comparatively permanent breeding sites are in quarries around the town of Karnobat and the city of Burgas [7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 14] and along the vertical shores of the Northern Black Sea coast [13, 14]. Colonies emerge non-periodically in other parts of the country as well [14]. The numbers vary widely, in years of invasion of up to thousands of breeding pairs. Registered in 1995 in the Bolata locality was the largest colony in Bulgaria: 5 000 pairs [13]; together with the young birds that left the nests in the middle of July, about 30 000 birds were registered in the region. During migration it is reported throughout the country (sometimes in flocks of thousands), most frequently at the end of May [1, 3, 15]; at that time of the year in the Sofia region the flocks usually fly to the northeast [15].</p>
		<p><b>Habitats.</b> Ground and rocky shores, including coastal slopes; stone quarries; heaps of stones. Food habitats are different pastures and herbaceous associations, orchards.</p>
		<p><b>Biology.</b> A colonial species: the colonies in Bulgaria are sized between 10-40 and 5 000 pairs [3, 13]. The nests are situated in rock cracks [4]. Usually 5-6 gray-blue eggs are laid (each time) [4]. After leaving the nests, the adults often continue feeding the young ones in specific "kindergartens" [4, 13]. Orthoptera are the preferred food for the species, mostly grass-hopper [10, 13, 16], as well as the fruits of different trees [10, 12, 13, 17].</p>

		<h1>Western Orphean Warbler</h1>
		<p><b><i>Sylvia hortensis</i> (Gmelin, 1789)</b></p>
		<p>Order Passeriformes</p>
		<p>Family Sylviidae</p>
		<p><b>Conservation status:</b> <i>in Bulgaria:</i>
			<b>Vulnerable VU </b>[B1a, c(i, ii)], BDA-III; <i>International:</i> BeC-II, BoC-II, ECS-Spec 3.</p>
		<p><b>General distribution.</b> A Mediterranean species breeding in Southern Europe, Turkey, the Southern Caucasus Mountains, Central Asia and Northern Africa.</p>
		<p><b>Distribution and abundance in Bulgaria.</b> It is found only in the southernmost parts of the country: the valleys of the rivers Struma (in the north to the city of Blagoevgrad) and Mesta, the feet of the mountains Southern Pirin, Slavyanka, Ograzhden and Malashevska Planina, in the Eastern Rhodopes, Sakar, the Derventski Vazvisheniya (hills), the western slopes of Strandzha, in the areas of the cities of Sliven and Burgas and at cape Emine [1-20]. The density of the breeding population varies from 0,31 to 1,6 pairs/10ha. In separate years it may be absent in some of the habitats [17, 19, 20]. For the 1998-2000 period, an increase in the numbers was observed [21].</p>
		<p><b>Habitats.</b> Pseudomaquises and dry-loving formations similar to them of thorn, hornbeam, oak, juniper, etc., and among the thick shrubs overgrown with blackberry along the borders of extensively used moderately-sized areas of vineyards, orchards, vegetable gardens, etc.</p>
		<p><b>Biology.</b> The pairs occupy the breeding territory at the beginning of April. The nest is placed on thorn, <i>
				<i>Pyrus</i>
			</i>
			<i>amygdaliformis</i>, or among the thicket of blackberry. Laying the eggs is from the end of April to the end of May. Newly hatched ones are observed from the middle of May - until the middle of June. It feeds on insects and fruits [4, 7, 10, 11, 14, 17].</p>
		<p><b>Similar species.</b> None.</p>
		<p><b>Negative factors.</b> There are no data about factors with a direct effect. It is possible for an influence on the population to be exerted by the increased use of insecticides. The restrictedness of the characteristic biotope is a prerequisite for vulnerability. In the future, a definite negative effect would be played by the destruction of the typical habitats of the species restricted in area and distribution.</p>
		<p><b>Conservation measures taken.</b> Protected according to the Biological Diversity Act. Some of the habitats are within protected territories: the Tisata Reserve, Natural Phenomenon Cape Emine, Natural Phenomenon Malkiya Kozhuh. Most of the typical sites are not protected.</p>
		<p><b>Conservation measures needed.</b> Additional studies are necessary, related to the distribution, numbers, ecology and biology of the species. It is necessary that those sites where the highest density was registered be declared protected territories: in the mountains Sakar, Derventski Vazvisheniya (hills), Southern Pirin, Ograzhden and Malashevska Planina and of the whole Kresna Gorge.</p>

		<p><b>General distribution.</b> A paleoxeric species. Its basic area is from Southeastern Europe (the Balkans, the Black Sea coast), the Ukraine, Turkey to the east through Central and Eastern Asia to China and Mongolia; in the North it reaches the region of lake Baikal, and to the South Iran, Iraq, Tibet. There is a small population in Northwestern Africa (Algeria, Morocco) and the mountainous parts of Ethiopia.</p>
		<p><b>Distribution and abundance in Bulgaria.</b> A breeding summer visitor and passage migrant, as an exception wintering. In the past it was more widely distributed [1]. Today it is extinct as a breeding bird in most places. It is observed mainly in small water basins within Dobrudzha and along the Black Sea coast. About half of the breeding pairs inhabit the open terrains of Northeastern Bulgaria and the largest densities of breeding habitats are around the town of Glavinitsa, Silistra region. It also breeds in the region around Burgas and in the microreservoirs near Karnobat and Aytos. Today's abundance of the species is up to 15-20 breeding pairs.</p>
		<p><b>Habitats.</b> Lakes, fish farms and reservoirs with an open water area in open steppe and agrictultural areas. It often feeds in the fields, far from the water.</p>
		<p><b>Biology.</b> Well studied [2]. Courting and occupation of territories begins at the end of February and continues through March. The beginning of laying has been registered around 10 March at the earliest, but usually it is between 1 and 15 April. In rare cases (during the first breeding), laying begins considerably later, around 15 May. The incubation of the eggs continues for 28 – 30 days. Their numbers vary between 6 and 13. It feeds on insects, carrion, seeds.</p>
		<p><b>Similar species.</b> The Shelduck (<i>Tadorna tadorna</i>).</p>
		<p><b>Negative factors.</b> Loss and degradation of habitats. Illegal shooting and collecting.</p>
		<p><b>Conservation measures taken.</b> Protected since 1962. Included in the Red Data Book of Bulgaria (1985) as endangered. A 10-year programme for the reintroduction of the species in nature has been implemented. Yearly, between 20 and 30 young of the species hatched in Kalimok Biological Experimental Field Station (Institute of Zoology, BAS) are being restored in the Bulgarian nature.</p>
		<p><b>Conservation measures needed.</b> Studying the numbers and the area of the populations and the threats. Carrying out monitoring; designation of new protected territories; reintroduction of artificially bred young birds.</p>

		<p><b>General distribution.</b> A Palearctic species whose breeding area embraces Europe, Northwestern Africa and the eastern coast of the Mediterranean. The European population is estimated at 99 000 – 170 000 pairs [1].</p>
		<p><b>Distribution and abundance in Bulgaria.</b> A breeding summer visitor, passage migrant and winter visitor. In the past it was ubiquitously distributed near marshes, rivers and pools, although not very often incubating, with 50 breeding breeding places of Northwestern Bulgaria, near the Danube, the Black Sea coast, in the region around Sofia, the valleys of the rivers Struma and Maritsa [2]. At present there are no significant changes in the distribution of the breeding breeding places. In the 80s its numbers were estimated at 200-300 breeding pairs [1]. On the basis of studies made (1981-86), total numbers of up to 1 500 breeding pairs are supposed [3]. Recently it has been estimated at 3 000 – 3 500 [4] or 800 – 1 900 breeding pairs [5]. The numbers of the population wintering in the country amounts to 635 individuals at the average with a maximum of 881 in 2000 [6]. The major concentrations are in the non-freezing large water basins of Southern Bulgaria: the Maritsa-Iztok Complex, ballast quarries along the rivers Maritsa and Tundzha and the Black Sea coast [3].</p>
		<p><b>Similar species.</b> None.</p>
		<p><b>Habitats.</b> Freshwater fish farms, lakes and microreservoirs with an open water surface and vegetation.</p>
		<p><b>Biology.</b> It breeds in rush with a density of 30-40 stems/m2; laying the eggs (6,1 at the average) takes place between 10 May and 31 May and the first ten days of June; lethality reaches 86% and often has to do with the numbers of the water ray [3].</p>
		<p><b>Negative factors.</b> Decrease of the area of freshwater fish farms because of a change of their use. Destruction of the overgrowths of reed and rush. Purposeful killing by lessees of water basins.</p>
		<p><b>Conservation measures taken.</b> Protected according to the Biological Diversity Act. A considerable part of the breeding places is included in the <i>Natura 2000</i> protected zones.</p>
		<p><b>Conservation measures needed.</b> Measures must be envisioned in the future Management Plans of the territories included in <i>Natura 2000</i> against killing and disturbance of breeding birds by lessees of fish farms and microreservoirs.</p>

		<p><b>General distribution.</b> Probably a Sarmatian species breeding in Europe and Asia. The largest European populations are in Russia 7 500 – 11 000, Sweden 6 000 – 8 000, the Netherlands 5 000 – 8 000, Great Britain 5 800 – 10 800 breeding pairs.</p>
		<p><b>Distribution and abundance in Bulgaria.</b> A breeding summer visitor, passige migrant and winter visitor. It mainly breeds along the Black Sea coast, in the past it also bred along the Danube [1, 2]. At present, the total population is estimated at 30 – 65 breeding pairs [3]. During migration and wintering it is mainly concentrated along the Black Sea coast, less frequently within the country. Its largest concentrations have been registered during the winter in the lakes Atanasovsko and Pomoriysko, in the Southern Black Sea coast its total numbers being 2 081 at the average, with a maximum of 4 224 [4, 5, 6].</p>
		<p><b>Habitats.</b> Shore water basins, sea shallows, stony shores, vertical shores of stone and sand quarries, saltworks, tailings-ponds.</p>
		<p><b>Biology.</b> For breeding it uses old holes of foxes, badgers, underground hares, etc. etc. or digs them up alone in leoss shores. Less often it breeds in the hollows of trees or in reedbeds. It lays 5 – 12 white eggs. Incubation continues for 29 - 31 days and the clutch consists of 9 young ones at the average [8]. The young ones start flying at the age of 45 – 50 days, sexual maturity is reached in the second year [7, 8]. Feeding has been insufficiently studied (in the stomachs analyzed, small crustaceans have been found) [9].</p>
		<p><b>Similar species.</b> The Ruddy Shelduck (<i>Tadorna ferruginea</i>).</p>
		<p><b>Negative factors.</b> Loss of habitats and urbanization of a large part of the shore; eutrophication and drying up of the wetlands; increase of the numbers of the Jackal.</p>
		<p><b>Conservation measures taken.</b> Protected according to the Biological Diversity Act., included in the Red Data Book of Bulgaria (1985). The major biotopes along the Black Sea coast are declared Protected Territories and Ramsar Sites. In the lakes Atanasovsko and Pomoriysko, islands are made and dikes are enclosed for stopping predators. For Atanasovsko Ezero lake, a Management Plan has been adopted, including particular activities for the species.</p>

		<p><b>General distribution.</b> In Europe: the lands along the western coast of the Balkan peninsula, Malta, continental and island Greece, Macedonia, the southwestern corner of Bulgaria, the Eastern Rhodopes, the southwestern coast of the Caspian Sea. In Asia: Turkey, the Caucasus countries, Northwestern Iran, Northern Iraq, Turkmenistan, the eastern coasts of the Mediterranean, Jordan, the Sinai peninsula.</p>
		<p><b>Distribution and abundance in Bulgaria.</b> Only in the Petrich-Sandanski valley, the southern half of the Kresna gorge [1, 2, 3] and in the Eastern Rhodopes near Madzharovo [4]. In 1971-1975, of the 437 snakes of 11 species collected around the village of Gorna Breznitsa and the Kresna gorge, the cat snake took the last place in the number of individuals found (2 individuals = 0,45 %) [5]. Until 1958 the species had not been registered within the territory of Bulgaria [1]. In the 1980s a total of about 15 individuals were found. In the last 15 years, several individuals were found every year.</p>
		<p><b>Habitats.</b> Mainly dry rocky and stony places with thin herbaceous and bushy vegetation; it is also found in strongly sandy, flat places. The separate populations are entirely isolated between each other.</p>
		<p><b>Biology.</b> It lays 6 – 9 eggs, probably in the first half of July. The young ones do not differ in their colouring from the adults. It excellently climbs rocks, walls of buildings, etc. Deep in the mouth it has poisonous teeth with which it kills its prey (mainly lizards, sometimes small rodents, the young of swallows in the nests, etc.). For people it is harmless.</p>
		<p><b>Similar species.</b> It resembles young four-lined snakes and blotched snakes, mainly with its spotting. It is distinguished by its vertical pupil and the golden-gray iris of the eye.</p>
		<p><b>Negative factors.</b> Unstudied. Many individuals die on the roads run over by cars; there are cases of illegal gathering by local and foreign collectors.</p>
		<p><b>Conservation measures taken.</b> Included in the Bulgarian Red Data Book, 1985, in the category <i>rare</i>. The habitats near the volcanic Kozhuha hill near Petrich and the Tisata reserve in the southern part of the Kresna gorge are in protected territories; it has been portrayed on a poster for the protection of reptiles (1998). Almost all habitats fall within the <i>Natura 2000</i> network protected territories.</p>
		<p><b>Conservation measures needed.</b> Popularizing the nature conservation status of the species among the population; discontinuation of the quarry exploitation of Kozhuha; ban on the building of a motorway in the Kresna gorge; control over the activities of poachers.</p>

		<p><b>General distribution.</b> The Mediterranean coasts of Europe and many of the Mediterranean islands; in the east to Western Iran, Syria and Northern Iraq. It is also found along the northern coast of Africa. In the Balkan peninsula it is distributed in its southeastern half.</p>
		<p><b>Distribution and abundance in Bulgaria.</b> It is found almost throughout the country without its northwestern parts; singular individuals may be found there, brought from other places. In the mountains of Southwestern Bulgaria it has been found at altitudes of up to about 1300 m. The density of the populations is heavily influenced by human activity. In large territories in the flattest parts of the country, they are entirely destroyed, in others small scattered populations have remained. There are comparatively well preserved populations in Strandzha, the Eastern Rhodopes and the feet of the mountains around the Petrich-Sandanski valley[1].</p>
		<p><b>Habitats.</b> The populations existing at present mainly inhabit low mountainous and hilly regions, overgrown with bushes and low-stem forests; open grass spaces among them are preferred.</p>
		<p><b>Biology.</b> In May-July it lays 2 or 3 times from 2 to 8 almost ball-like eggs each time, that it buries in holes in the soil [2]. The eggs hatch in 70 – 100 days. Sexual maturity is reached at the age of 11 – 14 years. The largest and probably the oldest tortoises of both species have been found in Bulgaria [3]. It mainly feeds on grasses, fallen fruits, etc.</p>
		<p><b>Similar species.</b> The Eastern Hermann's Tortoise (<i>Testudo hermanni</i>) with which it is found together in many places. The tail of <i>T. hermanni</i> is considerably longer and ends in a horn ray.</p>
		<p><b>Negative factors.</b> Man's agricultural activity, especially in the last decades (creation of larger fields, irrigational systems, machine agriculture); elimination of the forms of the microrelief; destruction of the valley forests; collection for food by some groups of the human population, and for "curing", in spite of its proved uselessness. A negative impact is also made by large infrastructure building (motorways, gas pipelines, etc.), construction along the Black Sea coast, forest fires (especially in Southeastern Bulgaria), substitution of deciduous forests with coniferous ones.</p>
		<p><b>Conservation measures taken.</b> Regulations have been passed for a partial or full protection of both species of tortoises in 1961, 1981 and 1986; posters and stickers have been published popularizing their protection in 1985, 2001 and 2005; published in the press and broadcast on radio and TV are many materials concerning the protection of turtles. Many of the populations of the species fall within protected territories.</p>
		<p><b>Conservation measures needed.</b> Large popularization of the nature conservation status of tortoises; strict control and sanctioning the activities of poachers; explanation of the uselessness of "turtle cure"; territorial protection of the places with the densest populations and of separate endangered populations.</p>

			 Mojsisovics, 1889 [1] is found.</p>
		<p><b>Distribution and abundance in Bulgaria.</b> It is found throughout the country without its northeastern part [2, 3]. In the mountains of Southwestern Bulgaria it has been found at altitudes of up to about 1450 m. [4, 5]. The numbers are severely affected by human activities. Between 1986 and 2006 they were strongly fragmented, disappearing populations of both tortoise species were found mosaically on about 40 % of the territory of the country; in about 30 % turtles are entirely extinct, in about 20 % (the high mountainous regions) they were never present at all, and in about only 10 % of the populations they are in a comparatively good condition – mainly at the feet of the mountains in Southwestern Bulgaria, the Eastern Rhodopes, Sakar and Strandzha [5].</p>
		<p><b>Habitats.</b> Low mountainous and hilly regions, most frequently overgrown with thinned forests and shrubs.</p>
		<p><b>Biology.</b> 2-3 times a year it lays 2-5 elongated eggs each time. The young ones hatch in 90 – 120 days. It mainly feeds on vegetable food. They winter in crumbly soil, usually on southern slopes, burying themselves at depths of up to several tens of centimeters.</p>

Regulations have been passed for partial or full protection of both tortoise species (1961, 1981 and 1986); posters and stickers are published popularizing their protection (1985, 2001 and 2005); published in the press and broadcast on radio and TV are many materials about the protection of tortoises. Many of the populations of the species fall within protected territories.</p>
		<p><b>Conservation measures needed.</b> Large popularization of the nature conservation status of tortoises; strict control and sanctioning the activities of poachers; explaining the uselessness of "turtle cure"; territorial protection at the places with the densest populations and of separate endangered populations.</p>

		<p><b>General distribution.</b> A paleoxeric species common in Portugal, Spain, France, Italy, the Ukraine, Southern Russia, Kazakhstan. It winters in Portugal, Spain, France, Italy, Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, Turkey, Kazakhstan.</p>
		<p><b>Distribution and abundance in Bulgaria.</b> Rare passage migrant and winter visitor that in the past probably bred in the country until the 50s of the previous century [1]. In the last third of the 19th century and in the first half of the 20th century it was found (also in spring and summer and during the breeding period) near the village of Gabrovnitsa (Montana region), near the rivers Vit, Osam, Iskar (Pleven region), between the villages of Suvorovo and Vetrino (Varna region), near the town of General Toshevo and the villages of Beloklas, Krasen, Prisad and Karvuna (Dobrich region), between the town of Asenovgrad and the city of Plovdiv, in the regions of the cities/town of Haskovo, Pazardzhik, Stara Zagora, Sliven, Yambol, Burgas, near Kazanlak, Karnobat, Aytos, Kameno, in the Radomir and Sofia fields (the villages of Voluyak, Mramor, Kostinbrod, Bozhurishte, Petarch, Gurmazovo, Kubratovo, the town of Novi Iskar and the village of Kovachevtsi [1]. In 1970-1980 it was reported near the village of Staroseltsi (Pleven region) [3], the Taukliman locality (Dobrich region) and the town of Valchidol [2] etc. Numbers: unknown. At the end of the 19th century its numbers declined considerably because of the enlargement of agricultural areas [2]. Up to 10 individuals [4] are believed to be wintering in the country, but it has not been registered so far during the yearly mid-winter counts since 1977.</p>
		<p><b>Habitats.</b> Steppes and high-grass large and flat terrains (fallow lands, abandoned agricultural areas in flat and mountainous fields and foothill slopes. It settles secondarily in cultured steppes, meadows, pastures, hemp-fields, vineyards and places overgrown with Spear-grass, thorns and other bushes.</p>
		<p><b>Biology.</b> Ground-nesting, monogamous. It lays 2-6 eggs that incubate for 20-22 days. During the incubation the male guards the nest. It feeds on ground slow-moving insects and other invertebrates, on small vertebrates and vegetation parts.</p>
		<p><b>Similar species.</b> The Great Bustard (<i>Otis tarda</i>)<i>.</i>
		</p>
		<p><b>Negative factors.</b> Destruction and change of habitats (ploughing, planting monocultures), disturbance, illegal hunting, killing young birds when gathering crops by harvesters with no safety equipment fitted.</p>
		<p><b>Conservation measures taken.</b> A protected species as of 1962, included in the Red Data Book of Bulgaria. Possibilities are discussed for developing a long-term programme for captive breeding and the release of birds in steppe flat reserves; for focused ecological optimization of the regions for re-introduction – planting of various grass species characteristic of the region; for the elimination or decrease of disturbance during the breeding season (April – July).</p>

		<p><b>General distribution.</b> A Palearctic species spread in the countries of Europe, to the west of the Pyrenees, Switzerland, Northwestern Macedonia, Montenegro, the Ukraine, Byelorussia, Moldavia, Russia, Northern Mongolia, Northern Korea.</p>
		<p><b>Distribution and abundance in Bulgaria.</b> In the past a resident that existed in Bulgaria until the second half of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century. [1]. In the 19th century it bred in the region of Ruse, in Dobrudzha, at separate places in Rila, etc., and it is assumed that it settled in some regions [2]. It has been reported for the forests between Samuil and Vetovo in 1870 [3, 4], Rila in the valleys of the rivers Kriva Reka and Cherni Iskar in 1874 [5], the Rhodopes in the middle of the 19th century. [6]. It is assumed that the last singular birds were preserved until the end of the 1950s in the coniferous belt in Rila and along the open forest steppe sites in Northeastern Bulgaria and Dobrudzha [7]. The numbers in Bulgaria are unknown. Probably until the middle of the 20th century, it was still found in isolated and rarely visited forest regions of the country [2, 7].</p>
		<p><b>Habitats.</b> The transition zone between forest and steppe in the valleys (in the north) and up to an altitude of 2000-3000 m in the mountains (in the south). In Western and Central Europe mainly in coniferous, mixed and beech forests. It prefers thin forests with open sectors, wet meadows and bogs with bushes.</p>
		<p><b>Biology.</b> Resident with diurnal activity. Polygamous. In the spring males court in the open. Ground-nesting. It lays 6-11 eggs which the female incubates for 25-27 days. It reaches its sexual maturity in its first year. 40-60 % of the individuals survive. A second reduced clutch of 2-5 eggs is also possible. Food: mainly leaves, buds, tassels, sprouts, flowers, fruits and seeds of the spruce and other coniferous trees. The young ones feed on insects (mainly ants) and soft fruits.</p>

		</p>
		<p><b>Negative factors.</b> Destruction of habitats – deforestation of vast areas in the valleys and the foothills and substitution of high-stem forests and mixed forests with monotypical forests of the same age with a poor underbrush; excessive hunting; disturbance – grazing, building and tourism; climatic difficulties – a long, cool and wet spring.</p>
		<p><b>Conservation measures taken.</b> Attempts at the reacclimatization of Vitosha (1896) and Rila (1901); settling of singular pairs of foreign-land individuals [8]. Possibilities are disussed for a long-term programme for breeding captive birds and releasing them in forest mountainous reserves that are not inhabited by <i>Tetrao urogallus </i>(Capercaillie, Wood Grouse, Western Capercaillie); for focused ecological optimization of the region of re-introduction – planting of various herbaceous, bush and woody species, enriching the places in question with formicaries, etc.</p>

		<p><b>Conservation status:</b> <i>in Bulgaria:</i> <b>Endangered EN</b> B-1, BDA-II; <i>International:</i> BD-I,BeC-III.</p>
		<p><b>General distribution.</b> A Palearctic species whose area is sharply split and divided into 3 parts: Pyrenean, the Alpine-Balkan-Carpatian and Scandinavian-Siberian. The natural area embraces: Spain, France, Switzerland, Austria, Italy, Germany, the Czech Republic, Poland, Slovakia, Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia, Macedonia, Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, Byelorussia, the Ukraine, Romania, Bulgaria, Northern Greece. In the Eastern Palearctic its area is whole and reaches Siberia, Altai in Russia and Mongolia. It has been introduced in Scotland.</p>
		<p><b>Distribution and abundance in Bulgaria.</b> Resident. It was found in three major regions: the Rila-Pirin-Rhodope mountains (the largest one), the Western Balkans and the Vitosha region (the smallest one) [1]. The scanty population (20 individuals in 1965) of Vitosha mountain is most probably already extinct [1]. At present it is breeding in the Western Balkan range, the mountains Rila and Western Rhodopes, with declining numbers. In 1984, the total numbers in the country were 2 037 individuals [2], according to other estimates they were 500-800 [3] and even 2 000 breeding pairs [4].</p>
		<p><b>Habitats.</b> In the southern periphery of the area, in which Bulgaria is also located, it inhabits coniferous and mixed forests in the mountains. It prefers old forest massifs [5]. In the past it also inhabited the forest hilly landscapes.</p>
		<p><b>Biology.</b> A polygamous species breeding on the ground. It usually lays 6-9 eggs that the female incubates for about 26 days. It feeds on insects, fresh buds and leaves, mainly leaves of coniferous trees [6], predominantly Scotch pine (<i>Pinus sylvestris</i>).</p>
		<p><b>Similar species.</b> The Black Grouse (<i>Tetrao tetrix</i>)<i>.</i>
		</p>
		<p><b>Negative factors.</b> Sports hunting; loss and degradation of the habitats because of wood production, fires, etc.; disordered sexual ratios as a result of the selective shooting of male individuals because of their trophy value; restricted area, disturbance during wood production, construction in the mountains, etc.; import of grouses of a foreign origin.</p>
		<p><b>Conservation measures taken.</b> Included in the Red Data Book of Bulgaria (1985). The species is under a preservation regime and regulated use by nature. There is a ban on shooting males from 15 April to 15 May (Decree of the Council of Ministers No 151/13.06.2001). About half of the habitats are in Protected Territories.</p>
		<p><b>Conservation measures needed.</b> Placing the species under full protection; ban on hunting and the import of grouses of a foreign origin; unprotected habitats must be included in Protected Natural Territories; artificial breeding; restoration of the species in regions with former habitats.</p>

		<p><b>General distribution.</b> A Paleomontane species whose breeding area is in Southern Europe, Turkey, Iran, Central Asia, Pakistan, China.</p>
		<p><b>Distribution and abundance in Bulgaria.</b> Resident, in the middle of the 20th century it was registered in the Balkan range, Rila, Pirin, the Rhodopes [1, 2, 4, 6]. Singular pairs have been registered in the gorges of the rivers Kresna and Iskar [7]. The present distribution embraces the middle mountainous to the high mountainous belt of Rila, Pirin, the Central Balkan range, the Western Rhodopes [5], Slavyanka [10]. Separate pairs have also been reported in some rocky regions, situated lower: the Iskar Gorge (in front of the Balkan range) [8], Vrachanska Planina mountain, the gorges of the rivers Erma and Kresna, the Provadiya plateau [9, 10]. The numbers in the country are estimated at about 300-400 pairs [3].</p>
		<p><b>Habitats.</b> Vertical rock massifs in the high parts of the mountains; vast rock complexes in the moderately high mountainous belt. Rarely or periodically it breeds in low mountainous and front mountainous regions: gorges, karstic plateaus. During the autumn-winter period it makes vertical migrations and wanderings in rocky regions situated lower, also entering urban areas: Bansko, Pernik, Sofia, etc. [10]. In this period it goes tens of kilometers away from its breeding habitats.</p>
		<p><b>Biology.</b> It breeds in deep and well-protected shelters along vertical rocks, on the ceilings of large cave entrances; less frequently in walls of buildings (huts, shelters, etc.). The breeding period starts at the end of April to early May. The nest is built out of fine straws, small branches and moss, covered with feathers and hairs [7]. The female lays between 3 and 6 eggs, white, with dark colours in their obtuse end. Incubation lasts for 14 days. In about 4 weeks the young ones leave the nest. It feeds on insects.</p>

		<p><b>General distribution.</b> The westernmost habitats are in the Cantabrian Mountains (Northern Spain) and Central Spain, and the easternmost – along the eastern slopes of the Carpathian arch. The northern border of the area follows the coastal line of Europe from Bretagne and Normandy to Southern Denmark. In Southern Europe it is distributed sporadically in some high mountains where it is a glacial relict (for example, in Southern Italy and in the Balkan peninsula in the south to Peloponnese).</p>
		<p><b>Distribution and abundance in Bulgaria.</b> Only in the high mountains at altitudes between 900 and 2 500 m. In the Balkan range only near Petrohan [1]; in Sredna gora [2, 3, 4]; in Rila [4, 5, 6, 7]; in Osogovska mountain [4, 8]; in the Western Rhodopes [4, 5, 9, 10]. In some of the habitats (Yundola, 1995, Osogovska mountain, 2001-2006) it is abundant – up to about 30 individuals have been observed on an area of 1 m<sup>2</sup> in the shallow places of the water basin inhabited, in others the numbers in the last 4 decades abruptly decreased (Petrohan), in a third type singular individuals are observed or only larvae, in a fourth type the species was not confirmed after being found once in 1910 (Malak Bogdan peak). The distribution is typically relict composed by entirely isolated localityes.</p>
		<p><b>Habitats.</b> Stagnant or poorly flowing water basins, including such that are insignificant in their area and depth, but always with ample underwater vegetation, some also with overwater vegetation.</p>
		<p><b>Biology.</b> During the second half of the spring it lays 100-200 eggs on underwater plants. Metamorphosis takes place in the autumn. It spends the summer and the autumn on the ground under stumps, in soil cavities, etc. There are no sure data of the places of wintering in Bulgaria.</p>
		<p><b>Similar species.</b> It differs from the other newts in the Bulgarian fauna by the orange-red abdomen and neck, without dark spots on them.</p>
		<p><b>Negative factors.</b> Drying up some of the water basins inhabited (Petrohan) or their turning into dams with a changeable water level (Martvoto Yakorudsko lake), the destruction of the shore and the vegetation of the water basins inhabited, pollution with waste waters (Osogovo, Rila), artificial breeding with the rainbow trout which eats the larvae and the adult newts.</p>
		<p><b>Conservation measures taken.</b> Included in the Bulgarian Red Data Book, 1985, in the category <i>rare</i>. Some of the habitats are in protected territories (in the Rila National Park, the Rila Monastery Natural Park; in the zones of the European <i>Natura 2000</i> ecological network. The water basins inhabited near Petrohan are dug out because of their strong siltation (1987, 2004) and rotting stumps are placed near them, under which the newts find shelter; a poster about protected amphibians was published (1998); popular articles have been published about the significance and the preservation of the species, and a brochure about the habitat near Petrohan (2005).</p>
		<p><b>Conservation measures needed.</b> Prevention of the inhabited water basins against drying up, hydrotechnical activities causing a changing water level, preventing their pollution; disallowing artificial breeding with rapacious fish of the inhabited water basins; creation of new small water basins in the vicinity to those with severely endangered populations.</p>

			<b>Vulnerable VU</b> [B2a, D2], BDA-II, III; <i>International:</i> IUCN-LC, BeC-II, HD-II, IV.</p>
		<p><b>General distribution.</b> It is widely distributed in Europe: from Western France to Southwestern Siberia. The northern border is outlined by habitats in the southern half of the Scandinavian peninsula, in the southeast to 64&deg; 20' eastern longitude. The southern border passes through Southern France, to the north of the Alps, habitats in Northeastern Serbia, Northwestern Bulgaria, Central Romania, Moldova, the Ukraine and the middle courses of the large rivers flowing into the Black Sea.</p>
		<p><b>Distribution and abundance in Bulgaria.</b> Three sure habitats in the Western Balkan range and Vrachanski Balkan range, with total numbers not more than several hundred individuals. Their altitude is between 250 and 1400 m. The species was found in Bulgaria in 2005. The habitats are isolated from those in Serbia and Romania and are the southernmost in the area of the species.</p>
		<p><b>Habitats.</b> It spends the water phase in water basins different in size, weakly overgrown with underwater vegetation. The dry ground phase it probably spends in the forest regions near the water basins. It prefers poorly flowing and standing waters, most frequently with depths of over 0,5 m [1].</p>
		<p><b>Biology.</b> Reproduction in Bulgaria is unstudied. In June, sub-adult individuals in the water phase are most frequently observed. In the other parts of the area the water phase continues from February to May. It lays 200 – 400 eggs, rarely more (a chromosome anomaly discontinues the development of half of the eggs) [1].</p>
		<p><b>Similar species.</b> <i>T. karelinii</i>, from which it differs with its shorter limbs and the darker colours of the neck with small white and yellow dots. <i>T. dobrogicus</i>, from which it differs with the shorter limbs and the less markedly spotted belly.</p>
		<p><b>Negative factors.</b> Unstudied. A negative influence is probably exercised by industrial pollution, destruction and drying up of the water basins, and especially the introduction of rapacious species of fish. The influence of natural factors such as overgrowth, the decrease of the water level and eutrophication are usually of secondary importance.</p>
		<p><b>Conservation measures taken.</b> Two of the habitats fall within the territory of the natural park Vrachanski Balkan.</p>

		<p><b>Distribution and abundance in Bulgaria.</b> It is found only along the river Danube: near Vidin, Oryahovo, Svishtov, Belene island, Ruse, Lipnik forest park, the village of Obraztsov chiflik, the village of Nova Cherna (Tutrakan region), the village of Srebarna and the city of Silistra [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]. Singular individuals are known from most habitats. During 1985-2005 in the region of Kalimok (the village of Nova Cherna) during the autumn migrations from the water to the ground, hundreds of individuals were observed. There are no older data of numbers in the past. Probably, in many of the Danubian marshes and flooded areas dried up in the 1920-1960 period, populations in large numbers existed.</p>
		<p><b>Habitats.</b> Marshes, flooded areas, river mouths, irrigation and drainage canals with fresh water and ample vegetation along the Danube and some Danubian islands.</p>
		<p><b>Biology.</b> In the spring, after hectic wooing under the water, the male sticks spermatophore on underwater objects, that the female takes with its cloaka. Then it lays from several tens to several hundred slightly longitudinal eggs singularly or in small "chains" on the underwater plants. In the autumn, the newts leave the water and start living on the ground, where during the night they feed on worms, small mollusks, insects, etc. More intensive is their feeding during the "water period" of their life: on water insects and their larvae, small crustaceans, the larvae of frogs, etc. It winters on the ground in underground shelters.</p>
		<p><b>Similar species.</b> <i>Triturus karelinii</i> and <i>T. cristatus</i>. It differs from <i>T. karelinii</i> in the colouring of the neck: in the Danube crested newt it is amost entirely black, with scarce white and yellow dots; in the <i>T. karelinii</i> the neck is yellow, with dark spots. It differs from <i>T. cristatus</i> with the relatively shorter limbs and the markedly spotted belly.</p>
		<p><b>Negative factors.</b> Drying up many of the Danubian marshes and flooded areas in the previous century; the correction of the lowest courses of some of the Bulgarian Danube tributaries; pollution of some of the inhabited water basins with industrial and domestic waste, crude oil products, etc. The fish <i>Percottus glenii</i> accidentally introduced in the river Danube may have a durable negative effect on the populations of the species, which has already been proved in other countries [7].</p>
		<p><b>Conservation measures taken.</b> Some of the habitats are included in protected territories (the biosphere Srebarna reserve, Persinski marshes near Belene). Most of the wet zones near the Danube fall within the European <i>Natura 2000</i> ecological network.</p>
		<p><b>Conservation measures needed.</b> Protection of the water basins close to the Danube appropriate for the existence of the species against drying up, pollution with crude oil products, pesticides for combating pests and mosquitoes, etc.</p>

		<p><b>General distribution.</b> A Palearctic species with a vast breeding area and isolated habitats in Europe, Asia and Northern Africa. In the east it reaches Japan. It winters along the Atlantic coast of Europe, in the west to Iceland, in Southern Europe, along the shores of Africa, the Arab peninsula, Hindustan, Indochina, China and Indonesia.</p>
		<p><b>Distribution and abundance in Bulgaria.</b> A breeding summer visitor, passage migrant and winter visitor. At the end of the 19th and the first half of the 20th century, it was a comparatively numerous breeding species in the marshes throughout the country [1, 2]. After drying up most of the marshes during the 1950s, the breeding population declined drastically and the species now has a punctate distribution in the surviving marshy places along the shores and within the country. The decline in the major breeding places along the Black Sea coast continued in the following decades. At present the population is estimated at 15-35 pairs [3]. The last certain breeding of the species is from Uzun Geren: 1 breeding pair in 2005 (M. Dimitrov, unpublished data). During migrations it visits wetlands in the whole country, mainly along the Black Sea coast (during the autumn migration in Atanasovsko Ezero Lake, a concentration of a maximum of 6 574 individuals was reported [4]). In more recent times, for the region of the Burgas lakes a maximum of 3 248 individuals was registered, in 1999 [5]. The number of birds wintering in Bulgaria has been declining since 1975. In the past, a maximum of 924 were reported during the mid-winter counts [6], mainly in Atanasovsko Ezero Lake. For the 1985-2002 period, the number of individuals wintering in Bulgaria reached a maximum of 68 in 2001 [7].</p>

		<p><b>General distribution.</b> Practically in all oceans and seas of the moderate and tropical latitudes. The Black Sea population inhabits the coastal regions as a typical benthic form and is rarely found far into the sea at depths of more than 200 m [1; 2].</p>
		<p><b>Distribution and abundance in Bulgaria.</b> The problem of the taxonomic status of the Black Sea population as a separate subspecies is disputable [1], but a genetic isolation of this population has been established. This is the most rare Black Sea dolphin [1], which is a result of its way of living near the shore, its large size and low fertility [3]. The recent observations at the Bulgarian Black Sea coast are mostly made in its northern part. Two to five groups of 5-12 animals each were observed some 10-17 miles off cape Galata in the winters of 1992-5. In the autumn and in the spring they move 3 – 10 miles off the coast [4]. In 2004 separate bottle-nosed dolphins were seen near Kaliakra, Balchik and Byalata laguna (N. Davidkov, personal communication). 4 corpses washed ashore were registered between Pomorie and Sinemorets in 2003 [5]. The data about numbers are insufficient. In 1997 along the Turkish caost 485 bottle-nosed dolphins were counted, and in 1998 – 468 individuals [6]. Up to about 40 dolphins were counted in 1992, 1993 and 1994 during the autumn-winter season, in the region of Varna bay [ 4].</p>
		<p><b>Habitats.</b> The bottle-nosed dolphin is benthos-eating and hence, in practice, a shore form [1].</p>
		<p><b>Biology.</b> 10 species of fish have been registered in the food of the bottle-nosed dolphin (apart from benthic, during the seasonal fish migrations it also feeds on pelagic fish – anchovy, the Pontic shad). It lives for 25-30 years. Pregnancy lasts for 12 months. It gives birth to 1 young. The lactation period is 4 - 17 months. The females reach sexual maturity at the age of 5-6 years and later, the males at the age of 8-12 years [7;1].</p>
		<p><b>Similar species.</b> Larger than the other two bottle-nosed dolphins (an average length of 2.30 m). It differs in its habitus from the ordinary dolphin by the clear (sharp) border between the colour of the back and the belly [1].</p>
		<p><b>Negative factors.</b> Until the 80s, industrial fishing. Nowadays, the severe degradation of the Black Sea ecosystem; pollution of the waters; disturbance, poaching and catching for dolphinaria [2; 7; 8].</p>
		<p><b>Conservation measures taken.</b> Strictly protected according to the Biological Diversity Act. Included in the Bulgarian Red Data Book of 1985.</p>
		<p><b>Conservation measures needed.</b> Implementation of a common strategy for control over the activities in the Black Sea, guaranteed preservation of appropriate aquatories, monitoring [8].</p>

		<p><b>General distribution.</b> A cosmopolitan species distributed in Europe (without its northeastern parts), Africa and Madagascar island, Central Asia, America to the south of Canada, Indonesia and Australia. In Europe, two subspecies are found: <i>T. alba alba</i> and <i>T. alba guttata</i>. The former is distributed in Great Britain, Western Europe and the Scandinavian peninsula, the latter in central Europe and the Balkan peninsula. In Bulgaria it is the <i>T. alba guttata</i> that breeds, and <i>T. alba alba</i> is registered only in the autumn-winter period [1]. Hybrids between the two subspecies have also been found [2].</p>
		<p><b>Distribution and abundance in Bulgaria.</b> Resident and passage migrant. According to Patev (1950), it is very rare and perhaps in Southern Bulgaria it is <i>T. alba alba</i> that breeds. According to Peshev and Boev, this subspecies "rarely breeds in Bulgaria", but they do not mention concrete habitats. A rare breeding species for the country, represented by the subspecies <i>T. alba guttata</i> [5], registered in six breeding habitats: the cities of Sofia and Sliven, Atanasovko Ezero lake, the village of Hadzhidimitrovo (Yambol region), the towns of Lom and Ivaylovgrad. At present, 75 certain breeding habitats have been found, the species being distributed throughout the country [7]. According to other authors [10], the number of the habitats is 48. The data show that Southeastern Bulgaria (the regions of Yambol, Burgas and Plovdiv) is the most suitable area for breeding [7, 10, 11]. There is a concentration of habitats also in the Sofia region, and sporadic breeding has been registered in separate places in Northern Bulgaria, specifically Dobrudzha [7]. The estimates of the numbers vary: from 100-500 pairs [8] even to 1 300 – 1 700 [9], and according to [7] they are 200-700 pairs. According to our data, the breeding numbers are about 600 pairs. On the territory of Bulgaria and the neighbouring countries, there are wintering individuals flying in from Germany, the Czech Republic, Slovacia, the Netherlands and Hungary [6].</p>
		<p><b>Habitats.</b> Open landscapes, the environs of small towns and villages and deserted buildings around towns.</p>
		<p><b>Biology.</b> In Bulgaria it is understudied. It breeds in large hollows of trees at the edges of forests, and around urban areas in dark ceiling spaces or in special bird houses, not disturbed by people. In other parts of the breeding area the courting cry is registered at the beginning of March, and the female lays at the end of April. The full clutch contains from 3 to 8 eggs; in unfavourable years it breeds only one or two young ones [1]. In Bulgaria, in two breeding habitats (Atanasovsko Ezero lake and the town of Lom), a second clutch was proved [5]. In Bulgaria the species has an extended breeding period: the feeding of pluming young birds has been observed (I. Vatev, personal communication) at the end of August (Atanasovsko Ezero lake) and the beginning of September (near the wall of Studen Kladenets Reservoir). Found in the food are 71 nutrition components, small mammals having the major share [12, 13].</p>
		<p><b>Negative factors.</b> Disturbance during the multiplication period and illegal shooting.</p>
		<p><b>Conservation measures taken.</b> Protected according to the Biological Diversity Act (2002). The habitat in Atanasovsko Ezero lake is within a Protected Territory.</p>
		<p><b>Conservation measures needed.</b> Studying the distribution and the biology of the species in the country. Increase of the nature preservation awareness of the population.</p>

		<p><b>Distribution and abundance in Bulgaria.</b> In the past, the species was found in most marshes along the Danube River [1]. Then, for a long time (over 80 years), it had not been recorded, and therefore, it was not included in the comprehensive works on the ichthyofauna of Bulgaria [2, 3]. In 2004, the species was found again in Srebarna Lake, in the canal connecting the lake with the Danube River [4]. There are no data about the state of the Bulgarian population.</p>
		<p><b>Habitats.</b> It is found only in permanent fresh water marshes and flooded areas of rivers overgrown with dense macrophytic vegetation.</p>
		<p><b>Biology.</b> The species reaches sexual maturity at the age of 2 years. It spawns in the period between March and April, building peculiar nests that are guarded by the females. The fecundity of the females ranges from 1 500 to 3 000 eggs. It feeds on zooplankton and insect larvae. The life span is about 7 years [5].</p>
		<p><b>Similar species.</b> In Bulgaria, none.</p>

		<p><i>Ursus arctos</i> L., 1758</p>
		<p>Order Carnivora</p>
		<p>Family Ursidae</p>
		<p><b>Conservation status:</b> <i>in Bulgaria</i>: <b>Endangered EN </b>[C2a(i)], BDA-II, III; <i>International:</i> BeC-II, CITES-II, HD-II, IV.</p>
		<p><b>General distribution.</b> North America; Palearctic Asia; Northern and Eastern Europe, the Carpatians. The Balkan peninsula and several regions in Spain and Italy are inhabited by a genetically differentiated, relic, Pleistocene population [1].</p>
		<p><b>Distribution and abundance in Bulgaria.</b> Until the end of the 19th century, in all mountains and in the Ludogorie region. After the 1930s it was preserved only in the Central Balkan range and the Rila-Rhodope massif. In 1980 the numbers were estimated at 600 individuals [2], in 1992 about 800, but this is an overestimation. The brown bear inhabits a territory with an area of 1,1 mln ha; the numbers in the Central Balkan range are 150 to 190 individuals, and in the Rila-Rhodope massif 300-360 (including cubs) [3; 4; 5; 6; 7; B. Kirov, unpublished report]. Wandering in the neighbouring mountains are 25-30 bears, mainly young. In the two meta-populations the sexually mature individuals are 55-70 and 115-140 (including those from the Greek Rhodope). Another estimation for 2007 (A. Dutsov, pers. com.) gives similar total numbers: about 415-555 individuals. Since 1988, there have been cases of bears passing into the Western Balkan range, coming from the east or most probably from Serbia (Bulgarian Forestries Questionnaire, 1989).</p>
		<p><b>Habitats.</b> Coniferous and deciduous forests usually over 600 –1 000 m, subalpine shrubs, rock massifs and gorges.</p>
		<p><b>Biology.</b> The females reach sexual maturity at the age of 3-4 years, the males at the age of 5-6 years. The mating season most often takes place in May-June. The female gives birth once every 2-3 years, mainly in caves, often near the upper border of the forest. The young ones, 2 at the average, are usually born in January, leaving the den in April and following their mother for 2 years. [3]. In Bulgaria only pregnant females have an obligatory lethargy. The region of the territorial bears is usually between 1 500 and 5 000 ha [3].</p>
		<p><b>Similar species.</b> None.</p>
		<p><b>Negative factors.</b> Isolation of the two meta-populations. Increased human poaching. Urbanization in the mountains; disturbance. Felling old natural forests. Feeding by man in the hunting farms (changing the ecology and the behaviour of the bears). Late maturity and high lethality up to the age of 3 years (up to 85 %) [8; 9; Raycho Ganchev, pers. com.].</p>
		<p><b>Conservation measures taken.</b> The species is protected as of 1993, with an exception for bears making damages. It was included in the Bulgarian Red Data Book of 1985. Declaration of the Central Balkan, Rila and Pirin national parks, and the Rila Monastery, Balgarka and Vitosha (where 20-25 % of the population is) natural parks. National and international programmes for the preservation of the species.</p>

		<p><b>General distribution.</b> From Northeastern Spain in the east to the border between Italy and Slovenia; in the north the area includes France (without the northern quarter), the westernmost part of Southern Germany (it is probably already extinct there), Western Switzerland, in the south – the whole of continental Italy and Sicily. Four individuals are known collected at the end of the 19th and the beginning of the 20th century in the Balkan peninsula, far from the area described: one from Saraevo in Bosnia, a second one near Ripan in Serbia and another two from Bulgaria [1].</p>
		<p><b>Distribution and abundance in Bulgaria.</b> From the territory of the country only two individuals are known: one large female, collected on 20 July 1933 near the village of Nadezhden, Harmanli region, and another one, male, collected earlier, but without a registered locality and a date of finding. It was probably found in the mountainous regions of the country [2]. There are no data of the numbers of the species in the past. It is supposed that the four Balkan individuals are last remains of a larger distribution of the species in the past that was later ousted by the nose-horned viper (<i>Vipera ammodytes</i>) [2]. The Harmanli specimen is the type individual of the subspecies <i>Vipera aspis balcanica</i> Buresch et Zonkov, 1934.</p>
		<p><b>Habitats.</b> In the main part of the area: mainly sunny, rocky and stony places. In the Pyrenees it has been found at altitudes of up to 2 900 m, and in the Alps at altitudes of up to 3000 m [3].</p>
		<p><b>Biology.</b> It gives birth to from 4 to 8 young. It feeds on small mammals, lizards, etc. Found in the stomach of the Bulgarian male individual with an unknown location was a swallowed rodent: an underground vole whose distribution in Bulgaria is mainly in the mountains [2].</p>
		<p><b>Similar species.</b> It resembles the common viper (<i>Vipera berus</i>) but differs from it by the upward tilted edge of the muzzle; in the viper, the flat upper surface of the head is without an upward tilted edge.</p>
		<p><b>Negative factors.</b> Unknown. Probably, the reasons for the disappearance of the species from the Balkan peninsula are not of an anthropogenic nature.</p>

		<p><b>Distribution and abundance in Bulgaria.</b> It is found only in the basins of the rivers Maritsa and Struma. The species was described from Bulgaria (the Maritsa River near Plovdiv). Later, it was found in other sections of the Maritsa River and in some of its tributaries: Vacha, Luda Yana, Stryama, Sazliyka, Topolnitsa, Chepelarska and Harmanliyska [1, 2, 3, 4]. It was recorded in the Batak Reservoir [5]. In the region of the Eastern Rhodopes, it was recorded in the Arda River, its tributary the Krumovitsa River, as well as in the Byala Reka River and the Studen Kladenets Reservoir [6]. It was also recorded in the reservoirs Kardzhali and Ivaylovgrad and in most of the Arda tributaries [7]. Recently, it has been caught in the rivers Stryama, Tundzha and Maritsa [M. Vassilev, unpublished data]. In the Struma River basin, the species was recorded in the Kresna Gorge [8], in the region of Blagoevgrad and in the tributary Pirinska Bistritsa River [9], but it is found in the entire river section from the border to as far upstream as the region of the Skrinski Gorge in the north [our data]. In the past, the species was comparatively abundant in the Maritsa River [3], but at present, it is rare.</p>
		<p><b>Habitats.</b> It is found mainly in the middle reaches and rarely in the lower reaches of permanent rivers with sandy and gravel bottom.</p>
		<p><b>Biology.</b> A reophilic species. It reaches sexual maturity at the age of 2-3 years. It makes spawning migrations upstream the rivers in the period May-July. Eggs are deposited over stony and gravel substrate. It feeds on benthic invertebrate animals and algae. It attains a maximum length of 30, rarely 40 cm [3, 10, our data].</p>
		<p><b>Similar species.</b> The vimba (<i>Vimba vimba</i>). The dark vimba is distinguished by the lack of a keel behind the dorsal fin and the less projected snout.</p>

			<b>Extinct EX</b>;  <i>International:</i> IUCN [EN B1 + 2abcd, C2a]; BeC-II; EE 92/43-II, IV; BDA-II, III.</p>
		<p><b>General distribution.</b> In Western and Central Europe it has a sporadic distibution, in small habitats, very distanced one from the other in Southeastern France, Central Italy, Austria, Hungary, the Krk island and the mountains in the western part of the Balkan peninsula; singular findings in Romania, Bulgaria, Pind mountain in Greece, in Southwestern Asia Minor. Many of these habitats have not been confirmed for tens of years, in others the species is on the brink of extinction or entirely extinct. To the east of the Danube delta, from Moldova to Northwestern China, the area is continuous and the populations have a high density. According to some contemporary authors [1], the Bulgarian individuals are close to <i>Vipera ursinii moldavica</i> Nilson, Andren et Joger, 1993.</p>
		<p><b>Distribution and abundance in Bulgaria.</b> The species has not been found in Bulgaria since 1934. Only 4 individuals are known, found in two distanced habitats: the forest plateau over the town of Shumen, where 2 individuals were collected in the first years of the 20th century, and Lyulin mountain, from where the other two individuals originate: one collected in 1927 near the village of Verdikal (near Bankya), and the other one in 1934, near Saint Kral monastery (today St. St. Cyril and Methodius monastery) near Knyazhevo [2], [3], [4]. The reports about the finding of one individual along the southern slopes of the Ludogorie plateau [5] are not truthful, as they pertain to an individual brought from another part of the area.</p>
		<p><b>Habitats.</b> Mainly grassy and steppe sites: from Alpine and sub-Alpine pastures (in Western Europe) to steppe and semi-desert landscapes (in Central Asia).</p>
		<p><b>Biology.</b> It gives birth to between 3 and 16 (most often 4– 6) young ones. The Lyulin individual from 1934 gave birth in terrarium conditions to 4 young ones [3]. It feeds on lizards, grass-hoppers, crickets, small rodents, etc. It rarely reaches a length of 55 cm. So far, truthful lethal cases of people as a result of its bite have not been registered.</p>
		<p><b>Similar species.</b> It resembles the common viper (<i>Vipera berus</i>), found in Bulgaria mainly in the high mountains. The dark zig-zag line of the meadow viper is narrow and wavy, and the cross-section of its body is rounded and trapez-like; in the common viper the line is large and strongly broken up, and the cross-section is elliptic-oval.</p>
		<p><b>Negative factors.</b> The acquisition of lands for agricultural purposes, pasture, mowing, burning down herbaceous and shrub places, intensive tourism. Probably the reasons are not only of an anthropogenic nature.</p>
		<p><b>Conservation measures.</b> Included in the Bulgarian Red Data Book, 1985, in category EX. The habitat near Shumen is partially included in the Shumensko plato Natural Park.</p>

		<p><b>Distribution and abundance in Bulgaria.</b> It inhabits mosaically the valleys, gorge fields and forest-free terrains in semi-mountainous regions. It is found more often in Northeastern and Southeastern Bulgaria and in the high fields of Western Bulgaria. [1; 2; 3; Bulgarian Forestries Questionnaire (1989), Z. Spiridonov, L. Mileva]. It numbers about 2 000 individuals (without the cubs) with a probable density of 1 individual/10 km<sup>2</sup>, calculated on 20% of the territory of the country (the potential habitats).</p>
		<p><b>Habitats.</b> Meadows, pastures, stony terrains, deserted lands, including river valleys, dry ravines, canyons. Preferred are the territories with large colonial rodents [2;3].</p>
		<p><b>Biology.</b> Understudied. The mating season is mainly in April-June; pregnancy lasts 8-11 months (with a latent period); it gives birth to an average of 4-5 cubs from January to May.

		<p><b>Negative factors.</b> Use of lands for agricultural needs; building on the land and the tourist invasion near the Rupite localite near the town of Petrich and the coast near Sozopol; death by cars on the roads (especially in the Kresna gorge); killing by local people; collection by poachers (in 1981-83 foreign poachers collected 85 individuals, around Sozopol, probably by digging up a wintering place); the quarry exploitation of Kozhuha near Petrich.</p>
		<p><b>Conservation measures taken.</b> Included in the Bulgarian Red Data Book, 1985, in the endangered category. The habitats in the Tisata reserve and near the Rupite locality are included in protected territories; it has been popularized many times in press editions with a large circulation; a poster was published for the protection of reptiles (1998). Almost all habitats fall within the <i>Natura 2000</i> network of protected territories.</p>
		<p><b>Conservation measures needed.</b> Promotion of the nature conservation status of the species, especially in the places it is found; strict control over the activities of poachers, especially in Kresna gorge and near Sozopol; ban on the building of a motorway in the Kresna gorge; discontinuation of the quarry development of Kozhuha near Petrich.</p>

		<p><b>Conservation status:</b> <i>in Bulgaria</i>: <b>Endangered EN </b>[A1a; B1a, b], BDA-II;<i> International</i>: IUCN [VU A1ce+2ce], BeC-III, HD-II.</p>
		<p><b>General distribution.</b> Europe: in the Danube River from Bavaria to the Black Sea. Its finding was reported in Austria, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Germany, Greece, Romania, Slovakia, Serbia, the Ukraine, Hungary, Croatia and the Czech Republic.</p>
		<p><b>Distribution and abundance in Bulgaria.</b> It was recorded in the Danube River and some of its biggest tributaries: the rivers Iskar, Vit, Osam and Yantra [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]. In the past, it ran far upstream the Danube tributaries – in the Iskar River as far upstream as Mezdra and Roman [2]. At present, it is an extremely rare species found only in the Danube River [8, 9].</p>
		<p><b>Habitats.</b> Only in permanent large rivers.</p>
		<p><b>Biology.</b> It inhabits sections with rapid current and gravel bottom. The spawning period is from March to April. The fecundity is comparatively low: between 600 and 4 200 eggs. The eggs are deposited on stones. It feeds during the night on benthic invertebrate animals. It reaches a maximum length of 17 cm and a maximum weight of 170 g. The life span is about 5 years [9].</p>
		<p><b>Similar species.</b> The zingel (<i>Zingel zingel</i>), from which it differs by the longer and slender caudal peduncle and the lower number of rays in the two dorsal fins: 8-9 hard rays in the first dorsal fin, and 12-13 soft rays in the second one.</p>
		<p><b>Negative factors.</b> The main threats to the species are water pollution and fluctuations in river discharge as a result of river regulation activities. A negative influence is also exerted by competition of cyprinids whose abundance in recent years increased, as well as poaching.</p>
		<p><b>Conservation measures taken.</b> The species was included in Annex II of the Biological Diversity Act (2002).</p>
		<p><b>Conservation measures needed.</b> Development and implementation of an Action Plan for the protection of the species in Bulgaria; introduction of a ban on fishing of the species; protection of the Danube River against pollution.</p>

		<p><b>Conservation status:</b> <i>in Bulgaria</i>: <b>Vulnerable VU</b> [A1a, c]; <i>International:</i> IUCN [DD], BeC-III.</p>
		<p><b>General distribution.</b> The northeastern Atlantic – the Black Sea, the Sea of Azov, the Sea of Marmara, and the Mediterranean Sea.</p>
		<p><b>Distribution and abundance in Bulgaria.</b> In the past, a common species for the Bulgarian Black Sea coast [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. It was recorded in the rivers Ropotamo and Karaagach [6], and in the lakes Varna, Burgas (Vaya) and Mandra [7]. In recent years, it has been found near Kaliakra [8], in Varna Bay [9], in the Ropotamo River [10] and in Pomoriysko Lake [our data]. Its occurrence in the Karaagach River has not been confirmed [11].</p>
		<p><b>Habitats.</b> Bottom-dwelling species. It inhabits the sea littoral area and the coastal lakes, mainly on fields of eel-grass (Zostera sp.).</p>
		<p><b>Biology.</b> It reaches sexual maturity at the age of 2 years [5]. It spawns repeatedly from April to July. Fecundity is in the range between 10 000 and 45 000 eggs. The females lay their eggs in nests, built of algae. It feeds on crustaceans, small fish, larvae of insects. It has a life span of about 5-6 years [12].</p>
		<p><b>Similar species.</b> In the Bulgarian section of the Black Sea, the following goby species, similar to the grass goby, can be found: <i>Gobius bucchichi</i>, <i>G. cobitis</i>, <i>G. niger</i> and <i>G. paganellus</i>. The grass goby differs from them by the higher number of scales in the lateral line (59-64) and the scaleless cheeks.</p>
		<p><b>Negative factors.</b> The main factors which caused the decrease in species abundance are the loss and degradation of habitats as a result of tourism and recreation development along the Black Sea coast, and the industrial pollution of water.</p>
		<p><b>Conservation measures taken.</b> The species was listed in the Red Data Book of the Black Sea (1999).</p>
		<p><b>Conservation measures needed.</b> Protection of the habitats against pollution, aimed at the restoration of the fields of <i>Zostera </i>sp.</p>
