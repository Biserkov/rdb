<h1>Introduction to volume 3 – Natural habitats</h1>
<p>Volume 3 of the <i>Red  Data Book of the Republic of Bulgaria</i>, entitled <i>Habitats</i>, is a qualitatively new stage in the study and  conservation of the biodiversity in the country. It is consistent with the  current trends in conservation biology and ecology, according to which the  conservation of the habitats and the environment is of major importance for the  conservation of the species. This new approach is the basis of international  regulations, which are binding on Bulgaria as an EU member state and  as a party to the international conventions. At national level, they are  integrated into the Biodiversity Act (BDA). </p>
<p>An important feature of Volume 3 is  that it becomes part of the elaboration of new theoretical approaches to study,  management and conservation of habitats as an important structural element of  biodiversity. The intensive study and classification of the diverse habitats  started in the 90's of the last century, with the project &quot;CORINE Biotopes&quot;  in Bulgaria  and the preparation of the first management plans for protected areas. Today,  still, no complete classification of plant communities based on the floristic (sygmatic)  method of Brown-Blanquet (1964) exists. Since this is the basis for habitat  classification we still do not have a detailed national mapping of their  distribution. The knowledge on the changes in the structure, functions and  threats to natural habitats is still limited. However, to meet public needs,  the authors have taken the responsibility both to present and analyze the  status of the natural habitats in Bulgaria in accordance with the  generally accepted classification schemes of Europe  and to assess their threats. For this purpose, the author teams include  phytocoenologists, botanists, foresters, mycologists, zoologists,  hydrobiologists and environmentalists who have experience in solving problems  related to natural habitats.</p>
<p>
	Five categories (extinct, critically  endangered, endangered, vulnerable, nearly  threatened) have been accepted to assess the conservation  status and these are based on criteria related to the main characteristics of  the habitats, i.e. geographical distributions, areas of distribution,  structure, functions, sustainability, restoration capacities and resilience rehabilitation  under exploitation pressure. As a result of the field studies and detailed  analyses of the existing habitats according to the EUNIS classification, 166  habitats of conservation importance have been identified in the country. They  are included in the Red Data Book and need specific conservation measures. They  belong to the following groups &ndash; marine habitats &ndash; 11; coastal habitats &ndash; 8;  inland waters &ndash; 21; mires, bogs and fens &ndash; 6; herbaceous communities and communities of lichens and mosses &ndash; 32;  shrub communities &ndash; 32; forests &ndash; 40; inland rock habitats &ndash; 16.</p><p>
	The habitats in volume 3 belong to four threat categories:</p>
<ul type="disc">
	<li>critically       endangered (CR) &ndash; 28;</li>
	<li>endangered       (ÅN) &ndash; 71;</li>
	<li>vulnerable       (VU) &ndash; 47;</li>
	<li>nearly threatened (NT) &ndash; 20. </li>
</ul>
<p>Thirty-two authors have contributed to volume 3. Some of them have  participated only in the elaboration of certain parts of the descriptions,  others played a more extensive role.</p>
<p> Each article in the volume is accompanied  by a UTM-grid map (10 km grid) of the habitat distribution in Bulgaria, based  on data provided by each author. The maps are indicative and not completely  comprehensive, especially in regards to the habitats of conservation importance  that are more widely distributed and less studied. The authors will be grateful  for any additional information or well-motivated suggestions for changes in this  respect. </p>
<p>The photos of the habitats are made by the authors themselves or have  been placed at the disposal of the authors by various experts. Their names are  listed in the annexes of the volume. The editors of Volume 3 <i>Habitats</i> express their sincere and deep  gratitude for the contributions to this edition. </p>
<p>The editors are also grateful  to Mr. Simeon Marin (Green Balkan Association) and Michal Hajek and Petra  Hajkova (Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic)  who have provided unpublished data from their projects which have been used in  the preparation of the maps in the volume. </p>
<p>The editors believe that the volume  will be used both by professionals &ndash; biologists, ecologists, foresters, conservationists  and experts from the Ministry of Environment and Waters and by the wider  audience &ndash; professors and students from different higher schools, pupils,  tourists, journalists and nature lovers who have an interest in the study and  conservation of the rich biodiversity of Bulgaria. The editorial staff will be  grateful for any criticism, recommendations, and corrections. The address to  which these should be sent is pressure as follows:</p>
