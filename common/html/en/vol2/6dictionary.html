	<h1>Glossary of terms</h1>
	<h3>Population and size of the population (Criteria  A, C, D)</h3>
	<p> The term <em>population</em> is used with a specific  meaning in the IUCN criteria, different from the ordinary use in biology. Here <em>population</em> stands for the total number  of the individuals of a given taxon. For functional reasons, mostly due to  differences in life forms, the size of the populations is measured using the  numbers of adult individuals only. In cases when some taxa are obligatorily  dependent on other taxa for their whole life cycle or a part of it,  biologically meaningful values must be used for the hosts.</p>
	<h3>Subpopulations (Criteria B and C)</h3>
	<p> The  subpopulations are geographically (or in some other way) distinguishable groups  in the population, between which there exists a small demographic or genetic  exchange (usually one successfully migrating individual or a gamete yearly, or  less often).</p>
	<h3>Adult individuals (Criteria A, B, C, D)</h3>
	<p> The number  of adult individuals represents the number of individuals for which it has been  established, or is supposed, that they can multiply. When this quantitative  indicator is estimated, the following is to be taken into account:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Adult  individuals that will never yield offspring must not be counted (for example,  when the density of the population is so low that it is not possible to have fertilization).</li>
		<li>In  populations with a disordered relation between the sexes, this fact must be  taken into account by using lower values for the numbers of adult individuals.</li>
		<li>In  cases when fluctuations in the size of the population are observed, lower  values must be used. In most cases, these values will be much lower than the  average ones.</li>
		<li>The  reproductive units in a given branch must be counted as individuals, unless  they are incapable of surviving independently (for example, corals).</li>
		<li>In  taxa for which the loss of all or some of the adult individuals at a given  moment of their life cycle is a natural process, the estimate must be made at  an appropriate time, when adult individuals are present and can multiply.</li>
		<li>Reintroduced  individuals are counted as adult only after they have already yielded vital offspring.</li>
	</ol>
	<h3>Generation (Criteria A, &#1057;, E)</h3>
	<p> The  lifetime of the generation is the average age of the parent individuals of the  present group of newly born individuals in the population. The lifetime of the  generation, therefore, reflects the change of the ratios between the  multiplying individuals in the population. The lifetime of the generation is  longer than the age at which the first multiplication takes place and smaller  than the age of the oldest individuals that are still multiplying (an exception  is represented by taxa that multiply only once). When the duration of the  generation changes in a state of threat, more natural values must be used for  the lifetime of the generation, i.e., before the appearance of the threat.</p>
	<h3>Decline of the size of the population (Criterion  A)</h3>
	<p> The decline  of the size of the population is a reduction of the number of adult individuals  with at least a percentage registered in the relevant criteria for the  indicated period of time, although the decline may not be a continuous  tendency. The decline must not be considered as part of the fluctuation of the  population, unless there is definite proof of this. The decrease of the number  of individuals as a result of a natural fluctuation in the size of the  population is, in principle, not considered to be a reduction.</p>
	<h3>Continuing decline (Criteria &#1042; and &#1057;)</h3>
	<p> The  continuing decline is a recent, current or forecast decrease of the size of the  population (it may be gradual, irregular or sporadic), that would last until  relevant preventive measures are taken. In principle, fluctuations are not  considered to be a continuing decline but also a continuing decline must not be  regarded as a fluctuation, unless there is proof for this.</p>
	<h3>Extreme fluctuations (Criteria &#1042; and &#1057;)</h3>
	<p> Extreme  fluctuations are observed in many taxa in which the size of the population or  its range change widely, rapidly and frequently, usually with variations larger  than a tenfold increase or decline of the population.</p>
	<h3>Strongly fragmented occurrence (Criterion &#1042;)</h3>
	<p> The  expression &ldquo;strongly fragmented occurrence&rdquo; pertains to situations in which the  increased risk of extinction is due to the fact that most of the individuals  are found in small and comparatively isolated subpopulations (in some cases  this may be established from the information about the habitat). These small  subpopulations may disappear, with a reduced probability for re-colonization.</p>
	<h3>Region of distribution (Criteria A and &#1042;)</h3>
	<p> The region  of distribution is defined as the territory bounded by the shortest  hypothetical continuing border that can be drawn so that it can embrace all  known or supposed sites of the modern distribution of the taxon, excepting  cases of vagrancy. This measure may preclude discontinuity or large  disjunctions of the total area of the taxon (for example, large areas with  habitats that are inappropriate for the taxon) (see also &ldquo;occupied area&rdquo;, art.  10). The area of distribution can often be measured with the help of the  &lsquo;minimal protruding polygon&rsquo; (the smallest polygon of which none of the  internal angles exceeds 180&deg; and that contains all the territories in which the  taxon is found).</p>
	<h3>Occupied area (Criteria A, B, D)</h3>
	<p> Occupied  area is defined as the area of the &lsquo;region of distribution&rsquo; that is occupied by  the taxon, excluding cases of vagrancy. This measure reflects the fact that a  given taxon usually does not occupy the whole area of its region of  distribution, that may also contain inappropriate and non-occupied habitats. In  some cases (for example, unchangeable colonial places for nesting, vitally  significant places for feeding with migrating species), the occupied area is  the smallest territory essential for the survival of the population of the  taxon in any phase. The size of the occupied area depends on the scale with  which the measurement is performed, hence a scale must be used that is  appropriate, taking into account the relevant biological aspects of the taxon,  the nature of the threatening factors, and the data available. To avoid  inconsistence and divergence in measurements as a result of the application of  different scales, standardization may be carried out if necessary, by using a  correcting factor for the scale. It is hard to give precise instructions as to  how standardization must be carried out, as the different taxa have different  types of scale-area interrelationships.</p>
	<h3>Habitat (Criteria B and D)</h3>
	<p> The term <em>habitat</em> refers to a geographical or  ecologically discernible territory in which a singular threatening factor may  rapidly affect all individuals of a given taxon. The size of the habitat  depends on the area on which a threatening factor is manifested and may include  part of one or more subpopulations. When a given taxon is under the threat of  more than one threatening factor, the habitat is defined by taking into account  the most serious threat.</p>
	<h3>Quantitative analysis (Criterion E)</h3>
	<p> A  quantitative analysis is any form of analysis through which the probability of  the extinction of a given taxon is estimated on the basis of its life history,  requirements with respect to the habitat, threats and certain manager&rsquo;s  options. Such a technology is the Population Viability Analysis (PVA). A  quantitative analysis must be based on all available data. In situations in  which there is limited information, the available data must be used in the best  possible way, in order to assess the risk of extinction (for example,  estimating the influence of accidental phenomena on the habitat). In the  presentation of the results of a quantitative analysis, the allowances made  (that must be appropriate and feasible), the data used, and the significance of  the data or the quantitative model must be documented.<strong><u></u></h3>
