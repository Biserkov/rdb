  <h1>Faunistic diversity of Bulgaria</h1>
  <p>The biological  diversity of a country or a geographical region depends on many factors, the  major ones being geographical position and relief, climatic peculiarities, the  presence of natural entities (rock composition, soil cover, water sources, and  water bodies), the anthropogenic effect on the environment, etc. The  combination of these factors determines to a large degree the richness of  biological species (micro-organisms, fungi, plants, and animals) that are the  major component of the biological diversity of a territory in question,  whatever its area and size.</p>
	<p>Bulgaria is  one of the European countries that are small in territory but in richness and  diversity of its fauna it is among the first countries in Europe. Its  geographical position in the southeastern corner of the continent, the complex paleogeographic  and paleoclimatic past, the various relief and climate, the presence of  sufficient freshwater resources, the closeness of the Black Sea, the large  forest fund, etc. are major significant factors favouring the existence of a  rich and original faunistic diversity. In the southern regions of the country  and along the Black Sea coast, there are thermophilic and xerophilic  Mediterranean species of animals, and in the northern and mountainous regions  many species typical of Central and Northern Europe and the Ukrainian steppes  occur together. Also considerable are the numbers of animals that are found solely  in Bulgaria or the Balkan Peninsula. They belong to the categories of <em>Bulgarian</em> and <em>Balkan endemics</em>. In many of the Bulgarian caves and in the southern  mountains, a large number of animal species found shelters and managed to  survive from times before or during the glaciations in Europe; now we relate  these species to the category of <em>relicts</em>.  These living fossils that survived from past geological periods in Bulgaria  reveal for the zoologists in the best possible way the ways of formation of the  Bulgarian fauna and its evolution. Bulgaria is characterized by its rich and  peculiar cave fauna with many endemics. In comparison with Central and Western  Europe, however, it is still insufficiently studied in faunistic terms; hence  the Bulgarian zoologists and ecologists face a lot of work for a complete and  comprehensive study of the Bulgarian rich and unique faunistic diversity.<br>
		The study  of the Bulgarian fauna started considerably later than that in other European  countries, for historical reasons. The first scanty data about the animal life  of Bulgaria were reported as early as 1726 by the Italian count Luigi Fernando  de Marsigli but they remained unnoticed and unknown for a long time for the  European naturalists. In the years before the Independence of Bulgaria, its  animal life was investigated only by foreign scientists, and later also by some  Bulgarian teachers who received their education abroad and worked at the end of  the 19th century. The first well-known foreign researchers who visited the  country and studied in more detail the Bulgarian fauna in the 19th century were  the Hungarian scientist Imre von Frivaldszky, the German ornithologist and  traveller Otto Finsch, the French naturalist Ami Bou&eacute;, the Russian zoologists  Edouard M&eacute;n&eacute;tri&egrave;s, Wassilij Radakoff and others. Among the first Bulgarian  teachers and naturalists who studied the Bulgarian fauna even before the  Independence were Georgi K. Hristovich from Sofia, and Hristo Pigulev from  Sliven. The beginning of Bulgarian zoological science is now thought to be attested  by the publication of the first scientific paper (Hristovich 1890) in Bulgarian by a Bulgarian researcher.</p>
<p>After the  Independence of Bulgaria, the first national research centres were established  in which regular and comprehensive investigations of the Bulgarian fauna were launched,  and the first Bulgarian zoologists started to be trained. In 1897, a Zoological  Institute at the Higher School in Sofia (now St. Kliment Ohridski University of  Sofia) was founded. It was headed by the first Bulgarian Professor in zoology,  Dr. Georgi Chichkoff, later a Corresponding Member of the Bulgarian Academy of  Sciences; lecturing in which were also the Croatian zoologist Professor Dr.  Stefan Jurinich and the Assistant Dimitar Ioakimoff. In 1889, the Museum of  Natural History was opened in Sofia, and in 1918 on its basis the Royal Natural  History Institutes were established, including departments of zoology and  entomology. In 1914, the prominent zoologist Dr. Ivan Buresch, later a Member  of the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences, was appointed Director of the Royal  Museum of Natural History. He organized, expanded and intensified the  investigations on the Bulgarian fauna and recruited prominent foreign  zoologists for that purpose. An important role for the development of national  zoological studies was also played by the journal <em>Bulletin of the Royal Natural History Institutes in Sofia</em> in which a  total of 129 papers, communications and other contributions on the Bulgarian  fauna by Bulgarian and foreign researchers were published after 1928. This scientific  field was further enhanced by the establishment in 1947 of an independent  Institute of Zoology at the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences, today having the  status of a national centre of zoological science.</p>
	<p>At the  beginning of the 21st century, after almost one hundred years of  research on the animal life of Bulgaria, we still cannot claim that we know  well the species diversity, the habitat distribution, the biological and  ecological peculiarities of the Bulgarian fauna. On the basis of the existing  data from the literature about the degree of exploration of the fauna of the  Central European and the neighbouring Balkan countries, we can expected that on  the territory of Bulgaria, including the Bulgarian sector of the Black Sea, not  less than 60-65&nbsp;000 animal species live, the enormous part of which are  invertebrates. However, we have at our disposal published data and evidence in  the Bulgarian and the international scientific literature only about  approximately 30&nbsp;000 animal species, which is about 50% of the supposed  faunistic diversity of this country. Best explored in Bulgaria, of course, are  the vertebrates, known among which are 800 species so far. The numbers of the  established species, genera, families and orders of all classes of vertebrates  in Bulgaria are shown in Table 1.</p>

<p>*According to Golemanski & Shishinjova (2001) </p>


	<p>The  investigations carried out so far of the richness and diversity of the  Bulgarian fauna allowed the finding and description for the first time of many  previously unknown animals, most of which inhabit only Bulgaria and some  neighbouring Balkan countries. The approximate number of the new genera and  species of animals, discovered and described from the territory of Bulgaria, is  over 800, most of which are endemics for Bulgaria and the Balkan Peninsula. The  total number of the endemic genera, species and subspecies of animals found so  far in Bulgaria is about 1200, of which the Bulgarian endemics are about 790,  and the Balkan endemics are about 410. The presence of endemics is one of the  important major criteria in international and national terms for determining  the strategies and the priorities for the conservation of the biological  diversity of a given country or region. Especially various and unique is the  cave and subterranean fauna in Bulgaria, as this country is rich in karst  formations and underground waters. Until 2005, over 780 species of cave animals  from various taxonomic groups were found in Bulgaria, among which more than 110  species inhabit the zone of eternal darkness, deep in the caves, and belong to  the category of typical <em>troglobites</em> (Beron <em>et al</em>. 2006). In richness, diversity and endemism of its cave  fauna, Bulgaria ranks among the first countries in Europe. Very rich and  various is also the fauna of the Bulgarian Black Sea coast, where over 2260  species and subspecies of animals were found until 1988, inhabiting the open  sea, the shore lakes and the supralittoral zone (Marinov &amp; Golemansky  1989).</p>
	<p>In  zoogeographical respect, the terrestrial fauna of Bulgaria belongs to the Palaearctic  Zoogeographical Region of the Holarctic Realm. Because of the fact that  Bulgaria is situated mainly in the Eurosiberian Zoogeographical Subregion but  also borders with the Mediterranean Zoogeographic Subregion, two major  zoogeographical complexes occur in this country: a northern one (Eurosiberian),  formed by cold-resistant animal species, and a southern one (Mediterranean),  including many thermophilic species (Josifov  1988).<br>
		From the  Northern complex, most widely distributed are the Holarctic species, living in  the Northern Hemisphere, both in Eurasia and in North America. Holarctic  species in the Bulgarian fauna are, for example, the Brown Bear, the Red Fox,  the Weasel, the Red Deer, the Golden Eagle, the Short-eared Owl, etc. Widely represented in this  country are the Palearctic animal species, also living to the north of the  Tropics but only in Europe, Asia and Northern Africa. Such are the Otter, the  White Stork, the Sky Lark, the Great Tit, the Common Toad, etc. The  Eurosiberian species of animals are most numerous. They are more cold-resistant  and penetrated in the Bulgarian territory from Northern Asia and Europe and for  many of them Bulgaria is the southern border of distribution. To this  zoogeographical category belong the Red Squirrel, the Bank Vole, the Badger,  the Roe Deer, the Capercaillie,  the Partridge, the Sand Lizard, etc. The Central European faunal elements have  similar ecological requirements with the Eurosiberian fauna. Such  representatives in this country are Miller&rsquo;s Water Shrew, the Common Pine Vole,  the Alpine Newt, the Fire-bellied Toad etc. Occurring from the northern  zoogeographical complex in Bulgaria, although with more restricted ranges, are steppe  species (the European Souslik, the Southern Birch Mouse, the Steppe Polecat,  the Great Bustard), Arctoalpine species (the Ring Ouzel), Boreomontane species  (the Viviparous Lizard, the Common Viper).</p>
	<p>The southern  zoogeographical complex is also well represented, especially in the southern  regions of Bulgaria. It almost entirely consists of Mediterranean faunal elements,  including two main groups: Holomediterranean and Pontomediterranean elements. A  part of this complex are also some less numerous faunal elements, such as  Iranian-Turanian ones, Pontian, Montane Mediterranean, etc. To the southern  zoogeographical complex in the Bulgarian fauna belong such peculiar species as  the Mouse-tailed Dormouse, Guenther&rsquo;s Vole, the Subalpine Warbler, the Balkan Terrapin, the  Leopard Snake, the Nose-horned Viper, the Stream Frog, etc. The numbers of the  so-called Cosmopolitan Species of animals are also rather large in the  Bulgarian fauna, especially among protists and lower invertebrates. Many of  them are synanthropic species cohabiting with man for many thousands of years already  (the Common Rat, the Ship Rat, the Common Cockroach, the German Cockroach, the  House Fly, etc.). Other species are distributed all over the world (the Great White Egret, the Peregrine Falcon, the Barn Owl, etc.).</p>
	<p>In the  second half of the 20th century, and especially in the last 2-3 decades, the  invasion and the pressure of man on nature, its natural resources, and  especially on the biological diversity increased on a worldwide scale. As early  as at the end of the 20th century, scientists warned that each year in the  1980s and 1990s several thousands of species of plants and animals had disappeared  worldwide, and if this threatening tendency is not stopped, about 50% of the  plants and animals currently living on the planet would disappear in the next  hundred years. The main threats for biological diversity worldwide are the  excessive exploitation of natural resources by man, the progressive and  accumulating pollution of the air, water and soil, intensive industrialization,  urbanization and the building of roads and communications associated with it, the  progressive development of tourism and tourist industry, etc. The recognition  of this global threat led to the organization of the historical UN Conference  on Environment and Development in Rio de Janeiro (1992), during which the  Convention on Biological Diversity was adopted. This convention is signed and  ratified now by more than 190 member countries of the UN.</p>
	<p>Bulgaria  could not avoid the rapid development of industrialization, urbanization,  mechanization and application of chemicals on a global and national scale as  well, and their consequences had a rapid negative effect on the faunistic  diversity in this country. The first edition of <em>The Red Data Book of Bulgaria Vol. 2</em> <em>Animals</em> (Botev, Peshev  1985) included 157 species of vertebrates, of which 16 species are entirely  extinct in this country but the numbers of threatened animals, including  invertebrates, were considerably larger. According to data from 2000, the  number of threatened animal species in Bulgaria, according to European  criteria, is estimated at more than 700; among them are also many invertebrates  (Nankinov 2000). In 1999, a  National Biodiversity Conservation Plan was prepared and adopted by the Council  of Ministers, with the active participation of Bulgarian researchers and nature  conservation activists. It specified the major priorities and actions in the  country necessary for the effective conservation of biological diversity. This second,  revised and updated, edition of <em>The Red  Data Book of Bulgaria</em> is an essential part of this National Plan, and the  team of authors hopes that it will prove to be an important and useful  scientific basis for the conservation of the faunistic richness and diversity  of Bulgaria in the following decades.</p>
