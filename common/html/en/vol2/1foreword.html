<h1>Introduction to Volume 2, Animals</h1>
<p>This second  edition of <em>The</em> <em>Red Data Book of Bulgaria, Volume 2</em>, <em>Animals</em> differs considerably from the first edition (Botev, Peshev 1985) both in form and in  content. A major important characteristic of the present edition is that it has  been adapted to the modern criteria and categories of the International Union  for Conservation of Nature (IUCN 1994, 2001) on the degree of threat of the  species, and this makes it comparable and usable by the international nature  conservation community. The criteria and categories of IUCN adopted in the  present edition are given in detail in a separate chapter in the general section  of the <em>Red Data Book</em>. </p>
<p>The  preparation of the first edition of the second volume, <em>Animals</em>, of the <em>Red Book of  Bulgaria</em> (Botev, Peshev 1985)  was based on the knowledge of about 18&nbsp;000 animal species found until 1980  in the Bulgarian fauna. In 2007, in Bulgaria already over 30&nbsp;000 species  of animals from a large number of taxonomic groups had been registered, and  their real current numbers in the country are probably over 60&nbsp;000. The  knowledge of their territorial and habitat distribution in Bulgaria, population  abundance, ecological peculiarities and resource importance have been  considerably broadened and expanded. For the purposes of the present edition,  all vertebrates and a large number of invertebrates of the Bulgarian fauna were  studied for an assessment of the degree of threat with a view to their  inclusion in the <em>Red Data Book</em>, and  more than 400 species of which correspond to the criteria of IUCN. As a result  of the expert assessment, it was established that, out of these, 287 species  and subspecies belong to the first four categories with highest degree of threat,  and they are included in this revised edition with detailed articles, drawings  and maps.</p>
<p>Included  with articles, for the first time in this new and more detailed edition of the <em>Red Data Book</em>, are 51 species of  invertebrates, of which 12 species are listed in the Extinct category and 39  are Critically Endangered. The estimation and the inclusion of invertebrates in  the <em>Red Data Book</em>, and the critical  re-assessment of the degree of threat of vertebrates in Bulgaria according to  the criteria of IUCN led to a considerable increase in the number of species in  the Bulgarian fauna included in this updated and revised edition. In comparison  with the first edition of the <em>Red Data  Book</em>, in which there was a total of 157 species and subspecies of animals  in three categories of threat, Extinct, Endangered and Rare, this second  edition contains articles, figures and distributional maps of a total of 287  species and subspecies of animals classified into the following four  categories: Extinct (30), Critically Endangered (87), Endangered (70), and  Vulnerable (100). In an appendix to the book, a List of Species determined as  Endangered, Vulnerable, Near Threatened and Least Concern is given, without  articles, figures and maps, due to insufficient information and lack of space.<br>
	New  information in this second edition of the <em>Red  Book</em> can be found in its general section containing articles about the  degree of our current knowledge on the faunistic diversity of Bulgaria, about  the history and the legislation for the conservation of the animal life in this  country, about the protected territories in Bulgaria, and the categories and  criteria of IUCN adopted in this edition. The Editorial Board thinks that this  general information would be useful for professional readers, i.e. ecologists  and nature conservation activists, as well as for the larger audience &ndash; lecturers,  teachers, students, journalists, fans of nature, etc. <br>
	More than  120 zoologists, specialists on different groups of animals from the Bulgarian  fauna, took part in the preparation of this new updated and extended edition of  the <em>Red Book</em>. The drawings and the  photographs included were made by eight highly qualified artists and animal  photographers. Their names are provided in a list in the appendices of this  book. The Editorial Board of Volume 2, <em>Animals</em>,  offers them all sincere thanks for their collaboration in the preparation of this  edition.</p>
