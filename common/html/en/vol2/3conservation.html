	<h1>Conservation of the animal world in Bulgaria</h1>
	<p>The beginning of activities for the preservation of separate animal  species in the Bulgarian lands probably dates back to distant prehistoric  times. It was as early as then that there were restrictions on the rights of  hunting, aimed at preserving game for people of a high social stature. Other  species were simultaneously protected by ancient beliefs, some of which exist  even today in folklore thinking: for example, about storks, swallows, etc. But  all these precursors of the preservation of the animal world are negligibly  small compared to the damages that man inflicted to the fauna of the Bulgarian  lands for thousands of years, either by direct killing of some species or  through abrupt changes of the environment. The first acts passed on hunting in  post-Liberation Bulgaria (in 1880 and 1897) cannot qualify as nature  preservation activity. In 1904, in another act on hunting was instigated, a  reward given for any &ldquo;harmful game&rdquo; shot down. Only the subsequent Hunting Act  (1909) waged war on human poaching and envisioned the creation of breeding  places for &ldquo;useful game.&rdquo;</p>
	<p>By the end  of the 19th century, the idea of nature preservation already had  many followers. The first published materials were in defense of forests. In  1896, Hristovich published in the <em>Priroda</em> (Nature) journal an article entitled <em>In  Defense of the Bird World</em>. A Society for the Protection of Useful Animals  and for the Destruction of Harmful Animals was founded in Svishtov. A very  important event in the development of nature protection work was the  establishment of the Union for the Protection of Nature, in the autumn of 1928.  On its initiative, the first regulatory document, the Nature Protection Act in  Bulgaria, was adopted in March 1936. It explicitly and specifically refers  several times to endangered and rare animal species and provides measures for  their preservation. In the subsequent Decree for Nature Protection (1960) there  is no special progress in this sphere. In 1967, the Nature Protection Act was  passed and its appendices lists many plants and animals placed under  protection. In the 1980s, the Committee for the Preservation of the Environment  at the Council of Ministers issued many special orders for placing many plant  and animal species (for example, the three orders of 1986 for the protection of  amphibians and reptiles, birds and mammals) under strict protection. Some  special orders for the protection of separate species or groups of species were  published (for example, for the protection of tortoises in 1981). Some  territories of special significance for the existence of separate populations  or associations of species were declared protected (for example, the rock  cliffs with bird colonies near the village of Gintsi in the Western Balkan range,  the abandoned mine gallery near the village of Golak in Ihtiman Sredna Gora Mt,  where colonies of many thousands of bats live, etc.). The use of industrially  important species (water frogs, snails, later of the adder as a source of  poison used in medicine) was regulated. In the middle of the 1980s, the <em>Red Book of Extinct, Rare and Endangered  Plants</em> (1984) appeared in Bulgaria, as well as the <em>Red Book of Animals</em> (1985). The area of protected territories and  buffer zones around them increased considerably. Hundreds of articles on nature  protection appeared in the mass media. Many illustrative papers (slogans,  brochures, etc.) were distributed. As a result of this activity, the ecological  and nature conservation cultures of the population in the country increased  considerably. As a whole, however, nature preservation activities were  insufficiently coordinated with international norms and standards until the  beginning of the 1990s. The success was to a large degree due to the sheer  enthusiasm of individual scientists and nature lovers, foresters, tourist  activists, etc.</p>
	<p>At the  beginning of the 1990s there began a rapid adaptation of the Bulgarian nature  preservation legislation to the international recommendations and agreements.  The Preservation of the Environment Act was passed in 1991. Some of the older  orders and decrees were invalidated because of their incomplete nature, because  of imperfections or because they contradicted newly passed regulatory  documents. World and international categories were adopted for both the  protected territories (this necessitated the re-categorization of many without  eliminating their protection), and the species placed under protection.  Trans-border cooperation started with neighbouring countries for protecting  species which are especially significant in conservation terms (e.g., the  so-called bear tunnels at the border with Greece). Many non-governmental nature  protection organizations and associations were established, and these carried  out extremely useful activities with or without the collaboration of authorized  state bodies, and sometimes in violation of their decisions. Many nature  protection activities in the country, mainly with respect to birds, are  performed with the financial support of international organizations (e.g., the  establishment of the Network of Ornithologically Important Places &ndash; with the  help of Birdlife International). Most attempts are directed towards projects of  a monitoring nature (for example, the yearly mid-winter counts of wintering  water-loving birds in the country or the periodic counts of the white stork).  The aim is to find many years of changes and tendencies in the development of  separate populations, associations or ecosystems. The populations of especially  valuable animal species are supported by special programmes (for example, the  feeding of eagles and vultures in the Eastern Rhodopi and the Vratsa Balkan  mountain; the creation and maintenance of water basins for the Alpine newts of  Petrohan). Control on human poaching as well as the intolerance to it have  increased.</p>
	<p>The  socio-economic changes that occurred during the last decades had a marked  effect on the natural environment in the country. The increased development of  infrastructure projects turns large spaces into ecological deserts and isolates  large natural territories. The severest consequences in this respect occur as a  result of the building of motorways. The urbanization of sites with exceptional  biodiversity such as the Black Seaside, parts of Northern Pirin, Rila, and the Rhodopi  mountain range deals heavy blows to nature. A serious threat is the projects  for some new industries (e.g., gold extraction with the use of cyanide). At the  same time, the depopulation of many border regions, the Eastern Balkan range  and other places freed vast territories from the anthropogenic stress and the  state of the biocoenosis in them, albeit slowly, is approaching the natural  one. Such territories turn into specific &ldquo;undeclared reserves&rdquo; and today they  have a richer and more various animal worlds than in past decades. The  abandoning of many arable lands in the country, the creation of boundary strips,  and other forms of microrelief, separate buildings, and the planting of wood  and shrub species in restitution lands has had a favourable effect on many  animal species from different groups. Finally, the discontinuation of many  types of industrial production and the building of purification stations is  good for the Bulgarian rivers: today they run less polluted and richer in life  than they used to.</p>
	<p>The  regulations through which the preservation of the animal world in Bulgaria is  carried out are mostly international ones, adopted by Bulgaria and now part of  the domestic regulatory framework: others are Bulgarian regulations that  conform to the international ones. A major document of international nature  preservation law is the Convention for the Preservation of the Biological  Diversity, adopted by the UN in 1992. Accordingly, every country must set up a  national plan or a strategy for the preservation of biodiversity; emphasizing  the necessity to make an assessment of the impact on the environment for  projects that might have a considerably negative effect on biological  diversity, the assessment being aimed at the prevention or minimalization of  that effect.</p>
	<p align="left">In accordance with the  Convention, a National Strategy was prepared in Bulgaria for the preservation  of biological diversity, adopted by the Bulgarian Council of Ministers in 1999.  Assessments of the impact on the environment already accompany almost all  significant construction projects, offering valuable recommendations and  sometimes preventing the building of objects or facilities that may seriously  damage nature. The introduction of foreign species of plants and animals has  been regulated: it envisages the discontinuation of the introduction of such  species, their control or their destruction when this is necessary. New species  of wild animals can be introduced only by the consent of experts from the  Bulgarian Academy of Sciences. Of extreme importance in the European  legislation are another two documents: the Convention on the Conservation of  European Wildlife and Natural Habitat (1979), also called the Bern Convention,  for short, and Council Directive 92/43/EEC on the  Conservation of Natural Habitats and of Wild Fauna and Flora (the  Directive on Habitats). Particularly about birds, the Council  Directive 79/409/EEC on the Conservation of Wild Birds (the &lsquo;Birds Directive&rsquo;)  was signed; the other groups of animals and plants are protected in the lists of  the Habitats Directive. The Bern Convention has three appendices: the first is  about plant species, the second and the third ones are about animal species  placed under protection. The most essential part of the Habitats Directive is  the setting up of the European <em>Natura  2000</em> Ecological Network that will consist of special regions for the  preservation of biological diversity. CITES, which came into force in 1975, is  the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and  Flora. It has three appendices: the first one is about species that are  threatened and are, or could be, affected by their trade; the second one is  about species that, although not threatened, may become threatened if trade  with them is not strictly regulated; the third is about species that one  country, party to the Convention, defined as subject to regulation through  jurisdiction with the aim of avoiding over-abuse because of trade. The import  or export of species listed in the appendices is solely allowed by the institutions  in charge in the countries that are party to the Convention. The Convention on  the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals (also known as CMS, or  the Bonn Convention, 1979) has a worldwide scope (not only a European one).  Three categories of the status of migratory species are specified in it:  favourable, unfavourable, and endangered. Enumerated in the annexes are the  species of the latter two categories. Closely related to the Bonn Convention is  the Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds  (AEWA, 1979). More narrowly profiled are EUROBATS, the Agreement on the  Conservation of Populations of European Bats (1991), and ACOBAMS, the Agreement  on the Conservation of Cetaceans of the Black Sea, Mediterranean Sea and  Contiguous Atlantic Area (1996), concerning dolphins in the Bulgarian fauna. Of  great significance for the preservation of the animal world is also the  Convention on Wetlands of International Importance especially as Waterfowl  Habitat (1975), also known as the Ramsar Convention (after the name of the city  in northern Iran where it was signed). Ramsar-protected wetlands in Bulgaria  are the reserves Srebarna, Atanasovsko Lake, Arkutino and others. The  Convention concerning fishing in the waters of the Danube (1958) and the  Convention concerning fishing in the Black Sea (1959) regulate the activities  for safe fishing, biotechnical measures for facilitating migratory species of  fish, etc.</p>
	<p>The  Biological Diversity Act passed in 2002 regulates the relationships between the  state, the municipalities and the legal and physical personalities on the  conservation and the stable use of the biological diversity in the Republic of  Bulgaria. It replaced the Nature Protection Act of 1967 and its nine amendments  adopted between 1977 and 2000. Biological diversity is declared an inseparable  part of the national heritage and its preservation is a priority of state and  municipal bodies and the citizens. Regulated is the establishment of a National  Ecological Network that is to include protected zones, protected territories,  and buffer zones around them. The introduction of non-local animal and plant  species in nature or their re-introduction is only allowed if this does not  bring any harm to the natural habitats or to local species of the wild flora  and fauna or their populations. The section on trade with endangered species is  adapted to the CITES convention. There are administrative penal clauses for  violations of the law, including the amount of fines, the procedure for the  confiscation of illegally possessed materials, etc. There are six appendices to  the Act. The first one is on the types of natural habitats in the country,  according to the Directive on Habitats of the European Union; 113 such types  are listed. The second one contains a list of the species for whose  preservation a priority conservation of the habitats is required; the species  of Resolution No 6 (1998) of the Bern Convention are marked with a special symbol.  Appendix 3 covers the species declared to be strictly protected in the  territory of the whole country; this list is numerous (426 species). The species  in the fourth appendix are placed under a preservation regime and regulated use.  Through an order, the modes of their use are specified for every separate  species. Listed in the fifth annex are the banned techniques, devices and means  of catching and killing animals. The sixth annex lists 16 species of hunting  birds for which, if proved that they were acquired in a legal manner, their  transportation, trade, stuffing, etc. are permitted. In 2006 (<em>State Gazette</em>, No 76), a tariff for  compensation for damaging or destroying protected plant or animal species from  Annex 3 of the Act was published. Of very large significance for the  preservation of the animal world of Bulgaria is also the Protected Territories  Act of 1998, with its amendments of 1999, 2000 and 2002.</p>
